We offer a wide range of investment options to suit different financial goals and risk tolerance. 

1. Mutual Funds: We offer various mutual funds options where you can benefit from diversification and professional management.

2. Stocks: You can invest in a variety of stocks from different sectors, allowing you to potentially enjoy high returns, though there's also high risk involved.

3. Bonds: Bonds are generally safer investments, where you lend money to an entity in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of the bond's face value when it matures.

4. Real Estate Investment Trusts: This enables you to invest in real estate without having to actually own any property yourself.

5. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs): These funds offer a mix of stocks, commodities, or bonds and they trade on an exchange like a stock. ETFs offer less risk than owning individual stocks, as they're diversified.

6. Certificate of Deposits (CDs): CDs are time deposits with a specific fixed term and fixed interest rate. They are considered a safe investment and are an excellent option if you have a low-risk tolerance.

Each of these investments carries different potential risks and rewards, and they may have eligibility criteria and specific documentary requirements. For detailed information on each of these investment options, and guidance on how to choose which is right for you, I suggest you speak with one of our investment advisors at your nearest branch.
