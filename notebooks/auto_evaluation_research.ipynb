Since the broker has automatically exercised a near the money option, it's solvency policy is already risky.

The next decision should be based upon risk and position selection.  First, if the position is no longer attractive, it should be closed.  Since it's deep in the money, simply closing out the exposure to the underlying should extinguish the liability as cash is not marginable, so the cash received from the closing out of the position will repay any margin debt. If the position in the underlying is still attractive then the liability should be managed according to one's liability policy and of course to margin limits. In a margin account, closing the underlying positions on the same day as the exercise will only be considered a day trade.

      "Reference Response:  For eToro, just like any other brokerage firm, you can lose your entire capital. I suggest that you invest in one or more exchange-traded funds that track major indexes.  If not, just put your money in fixed deposit accounts; gain a bit of interest and establish an emergency fund first before investing money that you feel you are able to lose.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Similar to other trading institutions, eToro carries the risk of total capital loss. My advice is to consider investing in one or several exchange-traded funds that follow key indices. If that doesn't appeal to you, consider storing your money in a fixed deposit account, earning minimal interest, and setting up an initial emergency fund before committing funds you are comfortable risking.\n",

      "Reference Response:  That is kind of the point, one of the hopes is that it incentivizes banks to stop storing money and start injecting it into the economy themselves. Compared to the European Central Bank investing directly into the economy the way the US central bank has been doing. (The Federal Reserve buying mortgage backed securities) On a country level, individual European countries have tried this before in recent times with no noticeable effect.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Essentially, the idea is to motivate banks to cease piling up money and instead pump it into the economy on their own. This is in contrast to the European Central Bank's approach of directly infusing money into the economy, akin to what the US central bank has been doing by purchasing mortgage-backed securities. In the past, individual European nations have attempted this with little to no observable impact.\n",

But your debt payments are... so if you have cash, the best way to \"invest\" it is to pay off your debt.  Since your car is depreciating while your house may be appreciating (don't know but it's possible) you should pay off your car loan first.  You're losing money in more than one way on that investment.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Settle your liabilities. As witnessed, the percentage of an \"investment\" is never assured. Nevertheless, your debt repayments are certain... thus, if you hold liquid assets, the optimal approach to \"invest\" them is by clearing your debt.

      "Reference Response:  Not sure if it is the same in the States as it is here in the UK (or possibly even depends on the lender) but if you have any amount outstanding on the loan then you wouldn't own the vehicle, the loan company would. This often offers extra protection if something goes wrong with the vehicle - a loan company talking to the manufacturer to get it resolved carries more weight than an individual. The laon company will have an army of lawyers (should it get that far) and a lot more resources to deal with anything, they may also throw in a courtesy car etc.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I'm not certain if it's the same in the US as it is in the UK (or potentially varies based on the lender), but if there's still a balance on the loan, then the car isn't truly owned by you, but by the loan company. This often provides an added layer of protection if there's an issue with the vehicle – the say of a loan company in dealing with the vehicle's manufacturer tends to have more influence than a single person. In the instance things escalate, the loan company has a team of lawyers and additional resources to tackle the situation, and they might also offer a replacement vehicle as a courtesy.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Being self employed just means you fill out some more forms in your annual self assessment for your \"profit\" from being self employed.  Profit = all the money you receive, minus any tax deductible cost that you spent for making that money (and all the cost must be documented, which means you have a folder with all the receipts and keep it safe). You pay normal income tax on all the profit, which means it is just added to your taxable income. What you do with the profit is up to you; you don't pay yourself a salary, just take the money (make sure you leave enough to pay your taxes).\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Self-employment essentially requires you to complete additional forms in your yearly self-appraisal for your \"profit\" earned from self-employment. The term \"profit\" refers to all the money you receive, subtracting any tax-deductible expenses incurred in making that income (and it's imperative that all these costs have proof i.e., all the receipts should be safely tucked away in a folder). You are obliged to pay standard income tax on all the profits which are then merged with your taxable income. What happens with the profit after that is your decision; you won't provide yourself a salary, simply withdraw the money, always remembering to reserve enough for tax payment.\n",

      "Reference Response:  In general, you can only be charged for services if there is some kind of contract. The contract doesn't have to be written, but you have to have agreed to it somehow. However, it is possible that you entered into a contract due to some clause in the home purchase contract or the contract with the home owners' association. There are also sometimes services you are legally required to get, such as regular inspection of heating furnaces (though I don't think this translates to automatic contracts). But in any case you would not be liable for services rendered before you entered into the contract, which sounds like it's the case here.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  As a rule, charges for services are typically linked to some form of agreement or contract. This doesn't necessarily mean it has to be in written form; a verbal agreement could suffice. Nonetheless, there might be situations where you unintentionally enter into a contract, like when certain clauses in your home purchase agreement or homeowners' association contract are triggered. Furthermore, there could also be services that are mandated by law, for instance, periodic furnace inspections, but these do not automatically translate into contracts. Importantly, you won't be held responsible for any service charges that were incurred prior to your entering into the contract, which appears to be what happened in this case.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Generally \"default\" means that the company cannot pay off their debts, and since debt holders get paid before equity holders, their equity would be effectively worthless. That said, companies can emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy (reorganization) and retain equity value, but it is rare. Most times, stocks are de-listed or frozen on stock exchanges, and company's reorganization plan will cancel all existing equity shares, instead focusing all of their attention on paying back as much debt as possible. If the company issues new equity after reorganizing, it might provide a way for holders of the original equity to exchange their shares for the new equity, but it is rare, and the value is usually significantly less that the value of the original equity.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Typically, when a company is in \"default,\" it implies they are unable to settle their obligations, and given that debtors are paid before shareholders, their shares may lose all value. However, in some instances, companies can undergo Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which is a reorganization process, and still maintain some value in their equity, though it is uncommon. Stocks often get taken off or suspended from stock exchanges in most cases. The company's restructuring strategy typically negates all existing shares, focusing all efforts on repaying as much debt as they can. If the company releases new equity following restructuring, those holding the previous equity might have a chance to trade their shares for the new ones, but this is not a common occurrence and the value is usually substantially less than the original equity.\n",

      "Paraphrased Response:  Bear markets present remarkable trading possibilities if you're well-informed about your actions. As a trader of futures and futures options, I'm equally adept at trading either on the long or short side.

      "Reference Response:  Diversification is a risk-mitigation strategy. When you invest in equities, you generally get a higher rate of return than a fixed income investment. But you have risks... a single company's market value can decline for all sorts of reasons, including factors outside of the control of management. Diversification lets you spread risk and concentrate on sectors that you feel offer the best value. Investing outside of your currency zone allows you to diversify more, but also introduces currency risks, which require a whole other level of understanding. Today, investing in emerging markets is very popular for US investors because these economies are booming and US monetary policy has been weakening the dollar for some time. A major bank failure in China or a flip to a strong dollar policy could literally implode those investments overnight. At the end of the day, invest in what you understand. Know the factors that can lower your investment value.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Diversification serves as a tactic for reducing risk. With equity investments, you can typically expect returns greater than those of fixed-income investments, though they carry their own risks. For instance, multiple factors including those beyond managerial control, can lead to a drop in a single company's market value. Diversification enables you to distribute the risk and focus on sectors you believe to hold the best value. Expanding your investments outside of your monetary zone allows for further diversification, but brings in additional currency-related risks that demand a deeper level of comprehension. Presently, with the rising economies, investment in emerging markets is well-liked among US investors, particularly as the US monetary policy has been diminishing the value of the dollar for a while. However, a severe bank collapse in China or a sudden shift to a robust dollar policy could potentially decimate those investments overnight. Ultimately, you should invest in things you comprehend. It is important to be aware of the elements that could reduce your investment's value.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Another good reason: if you have to replace a card due to damage, loss, or identity theft it's nice to have a backup you can use until the new card for your primary account arrives. I know folks who use a secondary card for online purchases specifically so they can kill it if necessary without impacting their other uses, online arguably being at more risk. If there's no yearly fee, and if you're already paying the bill in full every month, a second card/account is mostly harmless. If you have trouble restraining yourself with one card, a second could be dangerous.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Another valid point to consider: if your card needs replacement due to damage, misplacement, or identity theft, having a spare card is helpful while you wait for the arrival of your new card for the main account. I'm aware of people who reserve a separate card just for online transactions with the intent to disable it if required without disrupting their other operations, given the potentially higher risk associated with online transactions. If there are no annual charges, and if you're consistently clearing the bill every month, having an additional card or account is largely benign.

This is because they are beyond the saving for retirement phase and are now in the making-their-money-last phase. They also have issues related to health insurance, IRA RMDs, long term care insurance. The adviser will need to review what they have and determine how to make sure it is what they need. It is great idea for you to go along with them so you can understand what needs to be done. You will want an adviser that charges you a fee for making the plan, not one that makes a commission based on what products you buy or invest in.\n",

As they've moved past the accrual stage and now need focus on maintaining their wealth, they are facing unique circumstances, such as health insurance, IRA RMDs, and long-term care coverage. The financial expert should review their existing conditions and strategize to meet their needs. Joining them during their meetings is a beneficial approach as it will enable you to grasp what steps need to be taken.

      "Reference Response:  I'm not sure where you are, but in the United States capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than other types of income. On the 1040, captial gains income is separated from earned income, and income tax is calculated just on earned income. Then capital gains tax is calculated on capital gains income, and then added to income tax afterward.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I'm uncertain of your location, but in the US, the taxation rate for capital gains is less than that for other income categories. On form 1040, revenue from capital gains is distinguished from earned income, with the income tax solely based on the latter. Following this, the capital gains tax is computed based on the capital gains income and subsequently combined with the income tax.\n",

      "Reference Response:  You asked about the challenges. The transition itself is the biggest one. For people to get used to the tax at the register vs at their paycheck. For a great number of people to find new work. I don't know the numbers, but anyone involved with personal income taxes would be out of work. Sales tax is already part of the process in most states, bumping it to a federal tax wont add too much in overhead.  I make no moral judgment, but consider, most prostitutes and drug dealers are avoiding income tax, but they still are buying the same goods in stores you and I are. This proposed tax reduces the collection noncompliance, and brings more people into \"the system\".  Another factor some may not like is the ability to affect behavior by picking and choosing what to promote, via deductions, such as home buying or charity.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  You were inquiring about the difficulties. The most significant one is the transition itself. It is a challenge for individuals to adjust to tax being deducted at the point of sale instead of from their wages. Numerous people will need to seek new employment, and while I don't have the exact figures, anyone associated with personal income taxation will be unemployed. Most states already have a sales tax system in place, so introducing it at a national level wouldn't significantly increase cost burden. I'm not making any ethical evaluations, but bear in mind that many illicit workers, such as sex workers and drug dealers, evade income tax, yet they make the same purchases at stores just like us. This suggested tax decreases tax evasion and incorporates more individuals into \"the system\". Another aspect that may not appeal to some is the potential to influence behaviour by carefully selecting what to offer deductions on, like home purchase or charity work.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Consider the futures market. Traders buy and sell gold futures, but very few contracts, relatively speaking, result in delivery. The contracts are sold, and \"Open interest\" dwindles to near zero most months as the final date approaches. The seller buys back his short position, the buyer sells off his longs.  When I own a call, and am 'winning,' say the option that cost me $1 is now worth $2, I'd rather sell that option for even $1.95 than to buy 100 shares of a $148 stock. The punchline is that very few option buyers actually hope to own the stock in the end. Just like the futures, open interest falls as expiration approaches.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Take a look at the futures market. Gold futures are bought and sold by traders, however, only a small proportion of these contracts, in relative terms, actually lead to delivery. As the final date nears, the contracts are sold off and the \"Open interest\" consistently drops to nearly zero most months. The seller repurchases his short position, likewise, the buyer disposes of his longs. When I'm in a beneficial state with an owned call, for instance, the option I purchased for $1 is now valued at $2, I would prefer to trade that option for even $1.95, rather than buy 100 shares of a stock priced at $148.

      "Reference Response:  The car deal makes money 3 ways. If you pay in one lump payment. If the payment is greater than what they paid for the car, plus their expenses, they make a profit. They loan you the money. You make payments over months or years, if the total amount you pay is greater than what they paid for the car, plus their expenses, plus their finance expenses they make money. Of course the money takes years to come in, or they sell your loan to another business to get the money faster but in a smaller amount. You trade in a car and they sell it at a profit. Of course that new transaction could be a lump sum or a loan on the used car... They or course make money if you bring the car back for maintenance, or you buy lots of expensive dealer options. Some dealers wave two deals in front of you: get a 0% interest loan. These tend to be shorter 12 months vs 36,48,60 or even 72 months. The shorter length makes it harder for many to afford. If you can't swing the 12 large payments they offer you at x% loan for y years that keeps the payments in your budget. pay cash and get a rebate. If you take the rebate you can't get the 0% loan. If you take the 0% loan you can't get the rebate. The price you negotiate minus the rebate is enough to make a profit. The key is not letting them know which offer you are interested in. Don't even mention a trade in until the price of the new car has been finalized. Otherwise they will adjust the price, rebate, interest rate, length of loan,  and trade-in value to maximize their profit. The suggestion of running the numbers through a spreadsheet is a good one. If you get a loan for 2% from your bank/credit union for 3 years and the rebate from the dealer, it will cost less in total than the 0% loan from the dealer. The key is to get the loan approved by the bank/credit union before meeting with the dealer. The money from the bank looks like cash to the dealer.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  A car dealership generates profit in three ways. One method involves receiving full payment upfront. If that sum overshadows the cost of the vehicle and their expenses, they gain profit. The second way is by offering you a loan. The dealership profits if you pay more over time than their total price paid for the car, expenses, and finance costs. However, inflow of money could take years, so they might sell your loan to another firm to acquire the cash quicker, albeit in a smaller quantity. Lastly, they can make a profit by selling a car you trade in. This could then lead to another transaction as a one-time payment or another loan.

      "Dealers often propose two kinds of deals. One involves a 0% interest loan, typically shorter like 12 months as compared to 36,48,60 or even 72 months. The shorter duration can make it difficult for many to afford. If you can't handle the 12 large payments, they propose an x% loan for y years that fits your budget. The second choice is to pay cash and receive a rebate. However, if you opt for the rebate, you won't get a 0% loan and vice versa. The dealer is able to generate profit from the negotiated price minus the rebate. It's crucial not to disclose which offer you prefer immediately, or even mention a trade-in until the new car's price is established or else they'll alter the price, rebate, interest rate, loan term, and the trade-in value to maximise their earnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "When considering these options, running the numbers through a spreadsheet is a sensible strategy. For instance, if you procure a 2% loan from your banking institution for three years and a rebate from the dealer, it will end up costing less overall than the dealer’s 0% loan. The essential tip is to get the loan approved by your bank/credit union prior to consulting with the dealer, as the delivered loan is viewed as immediate cash by the dealer.\n",

      "Reference Response:  A board authorizes the repurchase of shares because they feel the stock in undervalued. The hope is that the stocks will rise either directly by their repurchase, or in the near term due to the realization that the company is in better shape then the market thought.

They will set limits on them maximum they will pay, they will also spread the repurchases out over a time period so they don't overwhelm the market.\n",

Over time, these shares are planned to be re-introduced to the market, hopefully generating more revenue at a future date.

      "Reference Response:  You can*, if the market is open, in a normal trading phase (no auction phase), works, and there is an existing bid or offer on the product you want to trade, at the time the market learns of your order. Keep in mind there are 2 prices: bid and offer. If the current bid and current offer were the same, it would immediately result in a trade, and thus the bid and offer are no longer the same. Market Makers are paid / given lower fees in order to maintain buy and sell prices (called quotes) at most times. These conditions are usually all true, but commonly fail for these reasons: Most markets have an order type of market order that says buy/sell at any price. There are still sanity checks put in place on the price, with the exact rules for valid prices depending on the stock, so unless it's a penny stock you won't suddenly pay ten times a stock's value. *The amount you can buy sell is limited by the quantity that exists on the bid and offer. If there is a bid or offer, the quantity is always at least 1.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  If the market is operational during a standard trading phase (not auction), you have the capability to place an order, given that there is a current bid or offer for the product you're interested in trading. Remember that two prices are involved: bid and offer. If the bid and offer match up, a trade is readily completed, causing the bid and offer prices to diverge. Market makers, who are offered reduced fees, are responsible for holding buy and sell prices (termed as quotes) most of the time. These circumstances are typically accurate, but commonly break down for several reasons: Most markets have a trading directive known as a market order, which authorizes buying/selling at any given price. Despite this, there still exists price sanity checks, with the specific regulations for acceptable prices contingent upon the stock. Consequently, unless it's a low-cost stock, you're not going to unexpectedly pay tenfold of a stock's value. Your ability to buy or sell is confined by the quantity available on the bid and offer. Should there be a bid or offer, the volume is always at least one.\n",

      "Paraphrased Response:  Enrolled Agents are typically known for their specialization in tax-related concerns. They have the authority to act on behalf of their clients when dealing with the IRS, a right that CPAs also possess. For further information on Enrolled Agents, you can visit the IRS website. Their area of expertise is more specific compared to a CPA and you would essentially engage them for counsel or representation about tax issues. For instance, you wouldn't employ an enrolled agent for an external audit. A CPA's credential has a wider scope and encompasses overall accounting, with taxes being just one component. It's not a given that a CPA will specialize in tax issues, therefore, if you're dealing with tax problems, particularly audits, reviews or appeals, you might want to investigate a potential CPA's experience with tax issues and client representation. If a CPA chooses not to engage in tax work and prefers areas like financial audits, an Enrolled Agent might be your best choice.

The safe outcome for the reporting agency is to remove the information in dispute  from reports within 30 days if the reporting party does not certify the information is complete and accurate (with other statutory timelines for communication to the customer and the reporter).   If you initiate a dispute, then the agency is following the law by deleting the reported information, outside new input from the furnisher.  If this is unsatisfactory, you have the following statutory right within § 611. Procedure in case of disputed accuracy [15 U.S.C. § 1681i (d) Notification of deletion of disputed information.

      "Reference Response:  One of the best answers to this question that I've ever read is in a paper published by Robert Lucas in the Journal of Economic Perspectives. That journal is meant to a be a place for experts to write about their area of expertise (in economics) for a general but still technically-minded audience. They recently opened up the journal as free to the public, which is a fantastic resource -- you no longer need a subscription to JSTOR (or whatever) to read it.  You can read the abstract to the paper, and find a link to it, here. One of the things that I like a lot about this paper is that it strips out absolutely everything even slightly unnecessary to thinking about a macroeconomy, and just discusses what one can arrive at with a very very simple model. Of course, with great simplicity come sacrifice about details. However, it does a great job of answering your question, \"why do people care about growth?\" A quick note: the key to understanding the answer to your question is to think about things in terms of \"the long term\"  -- not even looking forward to the future, because we'll be dead by then, but looking back to the past. The key to the importance of growth is that, for the last ~200 years, the US has, on average, had maybe 2-3% \"real growth\" per year (I'm pulling these numbers out of my head; I think much better numbers are in that paper somewhere). On average, over that period of time, this growth has meant that the quality of life that one has, if one lives in a country experiencing this growth, is enormous compared to countries that do not experience this average growth over that period.  Statistically speaking, growth is also somewhat auto-correlated. Roughly speaking, if it was low the last few periods, you can expect it to be low the next period. Same thing if it's high.   Then, the reason we care about growth right now: if you have too many periods of low growth, pretty soon the average \"over the long term\" growth will be pulled down -- and then quality of life can't be higher in the future (which quickly becomes someone's \"present\"). The paper above makes this point with a very simple model. Of course, none of this touches on distributional issues, which are another issue entirely. With respect to, \"The economy needs to grow to just keep up with its debt repayments,\" I think the answer is along the lines of, \"sometimes countries get into debt expecting that growth will increase their resources in the future, and thus they can pay back their debt.\" That strategy is, of course, the strategy that anyone borrowing (\"taking out a loan\") should be employing -- you should expect that your future income will be enough to pay back your interest+principle on a loan you took. Otherwise you're irresponsible. At the aggregate level, production is the nation's \"income\" -- it is what you have, all that you have (as a nation) to pay back any debt you've incurred at the national level.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  A piece to truly understand this query, in my opinion, would be Robert Lucas's paper published in the Journal of Economic Perspectives. This journal offers experts a platform to share knowledge, specifically in economics, with technically-minded readers. The fact that this journal now offers free public access is an excellent resource, no longer does one require a JSTOR subscription (or similar) to access it. You may read the paper's abstract and access the link to it, here. I appreciate this paper because it simplifies everything needless for understanding a macroeconomy to its most straightforward model. Still, remember, simplicity means overlooking some complexities. Incredibly, it lays out your question, \"why do people care about growth,\" beautifully. Quick point: the crux to comprehend your query relies on \"the long term\" perspective - not looking forward but looking back. We've seen importance in growth in the US over the last ~200 years, averaging perhaps 2-3% \"real growth\" annually (just giving an educated guess; the paper might provide more precise numbers). Such growth, over time, improves the quality of life remarkably, in comparison to nations not experiencing similar growth. From a statistical viewpoint, growth tends to correlate. Meaning, expect recurring instances of low or high growth. The present risk about growth: if there's a consistent pattern of low growth, it gradually reduces the average \"long term\" growth - thus diminishing the potential future increase in quality of life (which quickly becomes the current experience). The paper illustrates this point through a straightforward model. Note, this explanation doesn't delve into issues of distribution, an entirely different concern. As for \"The economy needs to grow to settle its debt repayments,\" I believe the answer might be something like, \"at times, countries borrow anticipating future growth to boost their resources to repay their debt.\" This strategy, of course, is what any borrower should follow- projecting future income to cover the interest and principal of your loan, else it's irresponsible. From a bigger perspective, production is a nation's \"income\" -- it is all that a country possesses to service any national level debts.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The game is not zero sum. When a friend and I chop down a tree, and build a house from it, the house has value, far greater than the value of a standing tree. Our labor has turned into something of value.  In theory, a company starts from an idea, and offers either a good or service to create value. There are scams that make it seem like a Vegas casino. There are times a stock will trade for well above what it should. When I buy the S&P index at a fair price for 1000 (through an etf or fund) and years later it's 1400, the gain isn't out of someone else's pocket, else the amount of wealth in the world would be fixed and that's not the case. Over time, investors lag the market return for multiple reasons, trading costs, bad timing, etc. Statements such as \"90% lose money\" are hyperbole meant to separate you from your money. A self fulfilling prophesy.   The question of lagging the market is another story - I have no data to support my observation, but I'd imagine that well over 90% lag the broad market. A detailed explanation is too long for this forum, but simply put, there are trading costs. If I invest in an S&P ETF that costs .1% per year, I'll see a return of say 9.9% over decades if the market return is 10%. Over 40 years, this is 4364% compounded, vs the index 4526% compounded, a difference of less than 4% in final wealth. There are load funds that charge more than this just to buy in (5% anyone?).  Lagging by a small fraction is a far cry from 'losing money.'  There is an annual report by a company named Dalbar that tracks investor performance. For the 20 year period ending 12/31/10 the S&P returned 9.14% and Dalbar calculates the average investor had an average return of 3.83%. Pretty bad, but not zero. Since you don't cite a particular article or source, there may be more to the story. Day traders are likely to lose. As are a series of other types of traders in other markets, Forex for one.  While your question may be interesting, its premise of \"many experts say....\" without naming even one leaves room for doubt.  Note - I've updated the link for the 2015 report. And 4 years later, I see that when searching on that 90% statistic, the articles are about day traders. That actually makes sense to me.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  This isn't a zero-sum game. Picture this - my friend and I fell a tree to construct a house; the house's worth is significantly higher than the tree in its natural state. The conversion of our labor into something more valuable is evident here. Ideally, companies spring from an idea and trade either a good or service to generate value. Yes, there are deceptive practices likened to a Vegas casino, and stocks can at times trade far beyond their worth. But when I purchase a fair-priced S&P index at 1000 (via an etf or fund) and later it shoots up to 1400, that increase is not at someone else's expense - if it were, global wealth would be a fixed quantity which it is not. There are several reasons why investors often fall behind the market return, such as trading costs, poor timing, and so forth. \"90% lose money\" is basically an exaggerated phrase aimed at parting you from your money. How prophetic! The issue of under-performing the market, however, is a different ball game - while I lack any concrete data to back my claim, I would bet that over 90% under-perform the expansive market. Explaining this in detail would exceed the bounds of this platform, but to put it briefly, there are trading fees. Investing in an S&P ETF with an annual .1% fee, would, assuming the market return is 10%, yield a 9.9% return over a long period. In 40 years, this multiplies to 4364% compounded, versus the index's compounded 4526% - a wealth difference of nearly 4%. There are load funds that charge more than this solely for entry (5%, anyone?). Markedly lagging isn't synonym to 'losing money.' What’s more, Dalbar, a company that monitors investor performance, reported that for the twenty-year period ending 12/31/10, while the S&P managed a return of 9.14%, the average investor only managed 3.83%- not great, but also not nil. Since no article or source has been referenced, there could be more to the narrative. For instance, day traders are usually on the losing end, and the same fate befalls several other traders in other markets, like Forex. While the question is intriguing, its basis on \"many experts say...\" without specifying any leaves room for skepticism. It seems notable to mention that a search for that 90% statistic reveals most articles are centered around day traders, which does add up in my perspective.

      "Reference Response:  Short selling can be a good strategy to hedge, but you have almost unlimited downside.  If a stock price skyrockets, you may be forced to cover your short by the brokerage before you want to or put up more capital. A smarter strategy to hedge, that limits your potential downside is to buy puts if you think the market is going down.  Your downside is limited to the total amount that you purchased the put for and no more. Another way to hedge is to SELL calls that are covered because you own the shares the calls refer to.  You might do this if you thought your stock was going to go down but you didn't want to sell your shares right now.  That way the only downside if the price goes up is you give up your shares at a predetermined price and you miss out on the upside, but your downside is now diminished by the premium you were paid for the option. (You'd still lose money if the shares went down since you still own them, but you got paid the option premium so that helps offset that).\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Despite the potential for hedging, short selling comes with a nearly boundless potential for loss. If the stock price soars high, the brokerage may compel you to cover your short even before you're prepared to, or demand additional capital. A more sensible approach to hedging, a method that caps your potential loss, is purchasing puts if you speculate a market downturn. The most you stand to lose this way is the initial capital outlay for the put, nothing more. An alternate hedging method involves SELLING covered calls because you possess the shares referred to by the calls. You may consider this if you anticipate your stock value falling but aren't prepared to offload your shares at this moment. Consequently, the only loss if the price escalates is you'll have to surrender your shares at a set price, forfeiting potential profit, but the downside risk is mitigated by the premium received for the option. Nonetheless, if the shares decline, you suffer a loss since you still own them, although the option premium received provides some counterbalance.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Automatic exercisions can be extremely risky, and the closer to the money the options are, the riskier their exercisions are. It is unlikely that the entire account has negative equity since a responsible broker would forcibly close all positions and pursue the holder for the balance of the debt to reduce solvency risk.  Since the broker has automatically exercised a near the money option, it's solvency policy is already risky. Regardless of whether there is negative equity or simply a liability, the least risky course of action is to sell enough of the underlying to satisfy the loan by closing all other positions if necessary as soon as possible. If there is a negative equity after trying to satisfy the loan, the account will need to be funded for the balance of the loan to pay for purchases of the underlying to fully satisfy the loan. Since the underlying can move in such a way to cause this loan to increase, the account should also be funded as soon as possible if necessary. Accounts after exercise For deep in the money exercised options, a call turns into a long underlying on margin while a put turns into a short underlying. The next decision should be based upon risk and position selection.  First, if the position is no longer attractive, it should be closed.  Since it's deep in the money, simply closing out the exposure to the underlying should extinguish the liability as cash is not marginable, so the cash received from the closing out of the position will repay any margin debt. If the position in the underlying is still attractive then the liability should be managed according to one's liability policy and of course to margin limits. In a margin account, closing the underlying positions on the same day as the exercise will only be considered a day trade.  If the positions are closed on any business day after the exercision, there will be no penalty or restriction. Cash option accounts While this is possible, many brokers force an upgrade to a margin account, and the ShareBuilder Options Account Agreement seems ambiguous, but their options trading page implies the upgrade. In a cash account, equities are not marginable, so any margin will trigger a margin call.  If the margin debt did not trigger a margin call then it is unlikely that it is a cash account as margin for any security in a cash account except for certain options trades is 100%. Equities are convertible to cash presumably at the bid, so during a call exercise, the exercisor or exercisor's broker pays cash for the underlying at the exercise price, and any deficit is financed with debt, thus underlying can be sold to satisfy that debt or be sold for cash as one normally would. To preempt a forced exercise as a call holder, one could short the underlying, but this will be more expensive, and since probably no broker allows shorting against the box because of its intended use to circumvent capital gains taxes by fraud.  The least expensive way to trade out of options positions is to close them themselves rather than take delivery.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Utilizing automatic exercises can be considerably dangerous, especially when the options approach the money, raising their exercise risk levels. It is doubtful that negative equity would encapsulate the whole account, given a conscientious broker would mandatorily shut down all positions and chase after the holder for the remaining debt, reducing solvency risk. Considering the broker has autocratically exercised an option nearing the money, its solvency policy is already predisposed to risk. Irrespective if it's negative equity or a simple liability, the safest action is to sell a sufficient amount of the underlying, so as to fulfill the loan by, if need be, closing all other positions expediently. Should negative equity persist post fulfilling the loan attempt, the account must be supplemented for the remainder of the loan in order to pay for the purchase of the underlying to completely fulfill the loan. Given that the underlying could shift in a manner that causes the loan to surge, the account should be supplemented urgently if required. Following being exercised for deep in the money options, a call morphs into a long underlying on margin while a put alternates to a short underlying. The ensuing decision should be grounded on risk and position selection. If the position has lost its appeal, it needs to be shut down. Being deep in the money, merely enacting closure to exposure to the underlying should quell the liability since cash isn't foreseeable in the margin, hence the cash procured from the position closure will take care of any margin debt. If the position in the underlying remains appealing then it's necessary to manage the liability according to one's liability policy and naturally, to margin quotas. In a margin account, shutting the underlying positions on the same day of exercise will only be tagged as a day trade. Positions shuttered on any business day post exercise will not attract penalty or restrictions. For cash option accounts, while it is viable, many brokers insist on a switch to a margin account. Even though the ShareBuilder Options Account Agreement appears indistinct, their options trading page suggests the switch. In a cash account, equities aren't flexible within the margin, hence any margin will prompt a margin call. If the margin debt didn't prompt a margin call, then it is unlikely a cash account since margin for any security in a cash account, barring specific options trades, is 100%. Equities are interchangeable with cash, likely at the bid, so during a call exercise, the exerciser or his broker pays cash for the underlying at the exercise price, and any shortfall is covered with debt, therefore the underlying can be bid to cover that debt or be sold for cash typically. To fend off a mandated exercise as a call holder, one could short the underlying, despite being costlier, and likely no broker would allow shorting against the box considering its intentional use to bypass capital gains taxes fraudulently. The most cost-effective method to trade out from options positions would be to personally shut them down rather than accepting delivery.\n",

      "Reference Response:  How long is a piece of string?  This will depend on many variables. How many trades will you make in a day? What income would you be expecting to make? What expectancy do you need to achieve? Which markets you will choose to trade?  Your first step should be to develop a Trading Plan, then develop your trading rules and your risk management. Then you should back test your strategy and then use a virtual account to practice losing on. Because one thing you will get is many losses. You have to learn to take a loss when the market moves against you. And you need to let your profits run and keep your losses small. A good book to start with is Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom by Van Tharp. It will teach you about Expectancy, Money Management, Risk Management and the Phycology of Trading. Two thing I can recommend are: 1) to look into position and trend trading and other types of short term trading instead of day trading. You would usually place your trades after market close together with your stops and avoid being in front of the screen all day trying to chase the market. You need to take your emotion out of your trading if you want to succeed; 2) don't trade penny stocks, trade commodities, FX or standard stocks, but keep away from penny stocks. Just because you can buy them for a penny does not mean they are cheap.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The length of a string is contingent on a multitude of variables. How many trades are you planning to execute in a day? What's your expected income? What revenue goals should you set? And what markets have you opted for trading? Your preliminary step must be devising a Trade Plan, followed by streamlining your trading rules and risk management measures. Next, you should evaluate your strategy through back-testing, and then use a simulated account for dealing with potential losses, as they are inevitably a part of trading. It's crucial to accept losses when the market isn't favorable, and to let your profits accumulate, all the while maintaining minimal losses. A beneficial starting point is the book 'Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom' by Van Tharp, which will guide you on Expectancy, Wealth Management, Risk Management, and Trading Psychology. I have two suggestions for you: 1) Look into position, trend trading and other short-term trading methods as alternatives to day trading. Ideally, you should place your trades once the market is closed, along with your stops, to avoid spending the whole day glued to the screen chasing the market. Emotions should be kept at bay to guarantee success in trading; 2) Avoid trading penny stocks, instead focus on commodities, FX or regular stocks, and steer clear of penny stocks. Just because they're available at a penny does not imply they are a bargain.\n",

      "Reference Response:  This sound like a very bad idea. If you invest exclusively in silver, your investment is not diversified in any way. This is what I would call risky. Have a look at index funds and ETFs and build a diversified portfolio. It does not take much time, and you don't need to let it do by someone else. They are risky too, but I see \"silver only\" as much riskier. You reduce the risk by holding on to the funds for a long time.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Investing solely in silver seems like an ill-advised plan. Should you choose to put your money exclusively into silver, there won't be any diversification in your investment, and this is what I identify as a high-risk approach. Consider exploring index funds and ETFs and construct a well-balanced portfolio. It's not a time-consuming process and there's no necessity for someone else to handle it for you.

They just about invented index funds, usually have the lowest (internal) expenses for index and many other funds, if you take electronic instead of paper statements there is no maintenance fee, have no transaction commission, can do periodic automatic investment from a bank account etc.  A typical index fund there would require an initial $3000 investment and would have a minimum of $100 for each additional investment.  If you can't come up with an initial sum of that size, you might be able to find a broker with a lower minimum and suitable free ETFs trades as others have suggested.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  For your needs, I'd suggest putting your money directly into a no-load mutual fund. I personally prefer Vanguard and believe you would too. Vanguard pioneered index funds, and typically has the smallest internal expenses for index and several other funds. If you opt for electronic over paper statements, you avoid a maintenance fee. They also don't charge for transactions and allow for regular automatic payments from your bank account. Usually, a traditional index fund there will require a first-time investment of $3000 and subsequent investments would need to be at least $100.

That makes housing loans cheaper as well - you get a home loan at around 10% in India versus 15% against most other assets, and since you can deduct it against tax, the effective interest rate is even lower.  Housing in India is unaffordable too, if you're wondering. In a suburb 40 Km away from Delhi, a 2000 sq. foot apartment, about 1500 sq. ft. of carpet area, with no appliances costs about USD 250,000.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In my home country of India, home loans are granted some precedence - the bank's capital requisites for such loans are less compared to say, a business or collateral loan. This contributes to the affordability of these loans, with home loans being around 10% as compared to approximately 15% for other assets. Notably, these rates can be written off against taxes, further reducing the effective rate. If you're curious, housing isn't cheap in India either.

Yes, unless it's done very blatantly, you should expect that the \"inflator\" has much more experience in hiding the signs of inflation than the skill of average investor to notice them.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Putting aside the specific example and concentrating on the real issues: Absolutely, the notion of the \"pump and dump scheme\" pertains to numerous situations purposely orchestrated; All things have their upper limit, which can be significantly high if beginning from something of low worth (like a penny stock), and, should the stock have low trading volume, a ten or hundred-fold increase in the actual value could be achievable; furthermore, any valuation can be infinitely overpriced if it’s for a company that ends up being worthless.

      "Reference Response:  I think you understood much of what I say, in general. Unfortunately, I didn't follow Patches math.  What I gleen from your summary is a 1% match to the 10% invested, but a .8% expense. The ETF VOO has a .05% annual fee, a bit better than SPY.  A quick few calculations show that the 10% bonus does offset a long run of the .75% excess expense compared to external investing. After decades, the 401(k) appears to still be a bit ahead. Not the dramatic delta suggested in the prior answer, but enough to stay with the 401(k) in this situation. The tiny match still makes the difference. Edit - the question you linked to. The 401(k) had no match, and an awful 1.2% annual expense. This combination is deadly for the younger investor. Always an exception to offer - a 25% marginal rate earner close to retiring at 15%. The 401(k) deposit saves him 25, but can soon be withdrawn at 15, it's worth a a few years of that fee to make this happen. For the young person who is planning a quick exit from the company, same deal.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In my opinion, you've generally comprehended much of my discourse. However, I found Patches' mathematical reasoning difficult to follow. Your synopsis seems to suggest that there is a 1% match for the 10% investment, but with a .8% expense. VOO ETF has an annual fee of just .05%, slightly superior to SPY. A swift series of computations reveal that the 10% bonus effectively negates the protracted duration of .75% surplus charges as opposed to external investments. Over the span of many years, the 401(k) manages to maintain slight superiority. It might not be the dramatic difference as previously indicated, but it's substantial enough to stick with the 401(k) under these circumstances. It seems the minimal match does create an impact. To amend - the query to which you referred. In that instance, the 401(k) neither had a match nor high annual charges of 1.2%. This duo can be fatal for an early-stage investor. Yet, there are always exceptions. A marginal rate earner of 25% nearing retirement at 15% is one such. The 401(k) deposit secures him 25, which can be withdrawn at 15 shortly, making a few years' worth of this fee justified. The same rule applies to the younger individual considering a swift exit from the organization.\n",

      "Reference Response:  It's a trade-off. The answer depends on your risk tolerance. Seeking higher rewards demands higher risk. If you want advice, I would recommend hiring an expert to design a plan which meets your needs. As a sample point, NOT necessarily right for anyone else...I'm considered an aggressive investor, and my own spread is still more conservative than many folks. I'm entirely in low-cost index funds, distributed as ... with the money tied up in a \"quiesced\" defined-contribution pension fund being treated as a low-yield bond. Some of these have beaten the indexes they're tracking, some haven't. My average yield since I started investing has been a bit over 10%/year (not including the company match on part of the 401k), which I consider Good Enough -- certainly good enough for something that requires near-zero attention from me. Past results are not a guarantee of future performance. This may be completely wrong for someone at a different point in their career and/or life and/or finances. I'm posting it only as an example, NOT a recommendation.  Regarding when to rebalance: Set some threshhold at which things have drifted too far from your preferred distribution (value of a fund being 5% off its target percentage in the mix is one rule I've sometimes used), and/or pick some reasonable (usually fairly low) frequency at which you'll actively rebalance (once a year, 4x/year, whenever you change your car's oil, something like that), and/or rebalance by selecting which funds you deposit additional money into whenever you're adding to the investments. Note that that last option avoids having to take capital gains, which is generally a good thing; you want as much of your profit to be long-term as possible, and to avoid triggering the \"wash sales\" rule. Generally, you do not have to rebalance very frequently unless you are doing something that I'd consider unreasonably risky, or unless you're managing such huge sums that a tiny fraction of a percent still adds up to real money.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  This is a balancing act, and the key lies in deciphering how much risk you're equipped to handle in your quest for higher returns. Enlisting the help of an expert to draw up a plan tailored to your needs is a wise option. Using my own investment strategy as a mere illustration, which may not suit everyone - I would categorize myself as a bold investor yet, my approach is more cautious compared to many. My entire portfolio is distributed across reasonably priced index funds with my frozen defined-contribution pension fund being equivalated to a low-yield bond. Some of these funds outperformed their tracked indexes while others couldn't. Since the inception of my investing journey my annual yield has been slightly above 10% (401k company match not included), which I find satisfactory, and it doesn't necessitate my constant attention either. But bear in mind, historical returns are not predictive of future outcomes. My story might not resonate with someone in a varied career, life or financial phase, I'm merely recounting it as an exemplar, not a guideline. Let's discuss rebalancing: Identify a limit beyond which your distribution strays too much from your ideal allocation ( a fund's value deviating 5% from its target proportion is an instance from my playbook), or set a relatively infrequent schedule for active rebalancing (annually, quarterly, or any such consistent interval), or rebalance by choosing which funds to pump additional money into every time you contribute more to your investments. This last tactic averts taking capital gains, which is typically preferable; your profits should be as long term as feasible to prevent invoking the \"wash sales\" rule. In general, there's no need to rebalance too often unless you're either adopting an exceedingly risky strategy or dealing with such immense wealth that even minute percentage points can translate to considerable sums of money.\n",

This is NOT a banking privilege, it is within the lawful ability of anyone capable of engaging in commerce. It is called a 'negotiable instrument' ... it gives the holder rights to a sum of money.  Notice that I say 'holder' ... this is what distinguishes it from a non-negotiable instrument, the fact that you don't need to redeem it from source, you can pass it to another who then becomes the 'holder in due course' and thus obtains the rights conferred. The conferable rights over a sum of money (or, indeed, other asset) are themselves 'value' Do banks do this ?  Yes, all the time! ... one of the simplest examples are cheques drawn against the bank, which are considered 'as good as cash'.  Usually they will be drawn out to the order of the person you wish to pay ... but can equally be drawn out to bearer.

This is referred to as a 'negotiable instrument', furnishing the possessor with access to a certain amount of money. The term 'holder' is used and this is what differentiates it from a non-negotiable instrument because it doesn't need to be cashed in at the source but can be handed off to someone else who then becomes the 'holder in due course' and thereby gains the given rights. The rights that can be given over a certain sum of money (or any other asset for that matter) are in themselves 'value'. Are banks involved in this? Absolutely, they do it consistently! Cheques drawn from the bank, seen as being as good as cash, are basic examples of this. Generally, these are made out to the person being paid, but they can also be made out to whoever holds the cheque. There really are no strict rules against making one out to the holder.

      "Reference Response:  Like all other loan-vs-savings questions, it depends on the terms of the loan. If you have a choice, the usual answer is to pay off the loan with the worst terms (which usually means the highest interest rate) first, and only start with savings when you've paid off all the high-interest loans entirely. If your student loan is on US terms, then pay it off as soon as you can, unless you have commercial debt (credit-card or unsecured personal loan), which you should pay off first, or unless you have or are realistically likely to get eligibility for a forgiveness program. But it does depends on the terms of the debt, which in turn depend on the country you studied in; on UK terms it's a very bad idea to pay off a student loan any faster than you have to.  Interest is restricted to the rate of inflation, so good investments probably beat the interest rate of the student loan; the required repayments vary with your income, so savings are more useful than debt repayment if you encounter income difficulties (e.g unemployment) in the future, and finally the debt is automatically forgiven after 30 years, so you may never have to pay it all back anyway - so why pay it off voluntarily if it would get forgiven eventually anyway?\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  As with any decisions about loans versus savings, it really hinges on the specifics of the debt. Typically, the best course of action is to first pay off the loan with the harshest conditions, often the one with the highest interest rate; only once these debts have been completely settled should you begin to consider saving.  If the terms of your student loan are based in the US, endeavor to pay it off as quickly as possible, unless you're burdened with commercial debt. This credit-card or unsecured personal loan should be your priority, or if you have a reasonable expectation to qualify for a loan forgiveness program. However, the stipulations of your debt, determined by the country of your education, play a key role; in the UK, for instance, accelerating your student loan payments is generally unwise. Since interest is pegged to inflation rates, profitable investments could potentially outpace your student loans' interest rate. Plus, as your mandatory repayments change with your earnings, having savings can be more beneficial than paying off your debt, particularly in case of unforeseen income hardships like job loss. Lastly, with debt being automatically waived after three decades, you might not have to pay the full amount after all, making voluntary payoff if the debt will get forgiven anyway, a counterproductive move.\n",

      "Reference Response:  There are some economic signs as there are in all economic and business cycles, such as interest rates rising. However, a more effective way is to actually look at price action itself. The definition of an uptrend is higher highs followed by higher lows. The definition of a downtrend is lower lows followed by lower highs. So if you are looking to invest for the long term you can look at the weekly or even the monthly chart of the market say over the past 10, 15 or 20 years. Using these definitions on say the S&P500 if the price continues to make higher highs and higher lows then stay in the market. If the price makes a lower high than the previous high, then this is a warning sign that the trend may be about to end. The trend has not broken yet but it is a warning sign that it could be ending soon. If the price makes a higher low next followed by a higher high, then the trend continues and you just need to keep an eye on things. If, however, the price makes a lower low after the lower high this is a signal that the uptrend is over and you should get out of the market. If the price makes a lower low directly after a higher high, then be cautious and wait for confirmation that the uptrend is over. If you then get a lower high this is confirmation that the uptrend is over, you would then sell if prices drop below the previous low. If you invest in individual shares then you should keep an eye on the charts for the index and individual shares as well. The index chart will give you an indication if the uptrend is over for the whole market, then you can be more cautious in regards to the individual shares. You can then plan exit points on each individual share if their trends are broken too. If you have stop losses employed and the trend reverses on the index, this would be a good time to tighten your stop losses on individual shares. You can then buy back into the market when you determine that the downtrend is broken and prices start to show higher highs and higher lows again. Will there be occasions when the uptrend reverses and then after a short period starts trending up again, yes there might be, but the worse that will happen is that you pay a bit of extra brokerage to get out and then back into the market, and you might have to pay some capital gains tax on any profits made. But remember no one ever went broke making a profit. The most important thing to remember when investing is to conserve and protect your capital. I would rather pay some extra brokerage and some capital gains tax than see my portfolio drop by 50% or more, then take 5 years or more to recover. And remember, paying tax is a good thing, it means you made money. If you don't want to pay any tax it means you will never make any profits, because if you make profits you will have to pay tax one day.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In every economic cycle, there are certain indications like the hike in interest rates. But a better approach implies examining the price movement. Recognize an uptrend as a sequence of high peaks followed by elevated lows, while a downtrend exhibits lower troughs leading to less high peaks. If you're aiming for long-term investments, consider viewing the weekly or monthly market graph for the previous decade, two decades, or more. Utilize these definitions on indexes such as the S&P500: if the price persists in exhibiting increasing peaks and lows, remain in the market. If the price indicates a lower peak than the preceding one, take this as a possible red flag that the trend might soon terminate. Even though the trend has not conclusively ended, this hints at its imminent conclusion. If next, the price illustrates an elevated low succeeded by a more peak, then the trend persists and requires your vigilance. If the price instead indicates a lower trough following the less peak, this alerts the finish of the uptrend, and the market should be exited. If a low follows a higher peak directly, adopt caution and await confirmation of the uptrend’s termination. If you are then shown a lower peak, this is proof that the uptrend ended and selling should occur if prices fall beneath the prior low. If you have invested in individual shares, not just the index, both should be monitored. The index graph can hint if the whole market's uptrend has concluded, allowing for more caution regarding individual shares. Exit points on each share can be decided if their trends also cease. Employing stop losses, tighten them on personal shares if the index illustrates a trend reversal. After confirming the end of the downtrend, the market can be re-entered as prices begin to align with higher peaks and lows. Occasionally, the uptrend may flip and s soon start an ascending trend. This occurrence might result in a little additional brokerage payment to exit and re-enter the market, and perhaps capital gains tax might need to be paid on the profits. Bear in mind, however, that making a profit never causes bankruptcy. The priority when investing should be preserving and protecting your finances. Personally, I would willingly pay extra brokerage and capital gains tax than witness a 50% or more decrease in my portfolio, and then experience a recovery phase of five years or more. And remember, paying tax is a positive sign as it indicates money was made. If tax payment is avoided, it implies no profits were made, since profits inevitably lead to tax payment.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Here's one reason that's being overlooked in answers so far. (@ChrisInEdmonton, this is for your comment on @Chad's answer.) How do credit card companies make money? Sure, there's interest charges, but those are offset significantly by the cost of borrowing money, and by people defaulting on their debt / entering bankruptcy. The other way they make money is by processing transactions. They get a cut of whatever you buy. If you're a high-income person, and you're going to process a lot of expenditures with this credit card, your business is worth more. They will be willing to bribe you with things like cash-back, frequent flier miles, and insurance on your auto rentals, so that they can be your #1 go-to card.  (This works in concert with the way that some credit card vendors with richer clientele overall - American Express - get to charge higher merchant fees for access to these customers' wallets. But that was mentioned in other answers.) If you're not a high-income person, your business is worth less. If you go somewhere asking for credit, they're going to try and give you a card which will earn them the most money - which probably isn't the one where they give you back 50% of their transaction fee in rewards. It's a calculated risk, since they still have to compete against cash, debit cards, and all the other credit card companies, so they don't have you totally over a barrel, but you shouldn't expect as many freebies, either.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  One overlooked aspect in earlier responses is this: How do credit card firms generate revenue? Yes, interest charges contribute, but they're largely balanced by costs related to loaning money and the risk of debtors defaulting or filing for bankruptcy. Another significant source of income for them involves transaction processing. They claim a portion of everything you purchase. If you're a high-earning individual using this credit card for multiple transactions, your business becomes more valuable to them. To ensure they remain as your preferred card, they may offer incentives such as cash-back, frequent flyer miles, and car rental insurance. This is complemented by some credit card providers (like American Express, who cater to wealthier clients) who can demand higher merchant fees in exchange for access to their customer base - though this point was covered in previous responses. However, if you're not a high-income individual, your business is less beneficial for them. When seeking a line of credit, they'll likely propose a card that maximizes their profit, possibly not the one offering a significant share of the transaction fee as rewards. It's a gamble because they must compete in the market, yet don't expect too many frills.\n",

      "Reference Response:  You need to pay off the entire balance of 7450 as soon as possible. This should be your primary financial goal at this point above anything else. A basic structure that you can follow is this: Is the £1500 balance with the 39.9% interest rate the obvious starting point here? Yes, that is fine. But all the cards and overdraft debts need to be treated with the same urgency! What are the prospects for improving my credit score in say the next 6-12 months enough to get a 0% balance transfer or loan for consolidation? This should not be a primary concern of yours if you want to move on with your financial life. Debt consolidation will not help you achieve the goals you have described (home ownership, financial stability). If you follow the advice here, by the time you get to the point of being eligible, you may not see enough savings in interest to make it worth the hassle. Focus on the hard stuff and pay off the balances. Is that realistic, or am I looking at a longer term struggle? You are looking at a significant struggle. If it was easy you would not be asking this question! The length of time will be determined by your choices: how aggressively you will cut your lifestyle, take on extra jobs, and place additional payments on your debt.  By being that extreme, you will actually start to see progress, which will be encouraging. If you go in half-committed, your progress will show as much and it will be demotivating. Much of your success will hinge on your mental and emotional toughness to push through the hard work of delaying pleasure and paying off these balances. That is just my personal experience, so you can take it or leave it. :) The credit score will take care of itself if you follow this method, so don't worry about it. Good Luck!\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The immediate payment of your full balance of 7450 should be your most pressing financial objective, superseding all other considerations. A helpful guideline could be this: Is it evident that the £1500 balance with 39.9% interest is the initial priority? Sure, that's acceptable. However, equal urgency must be given when addressing all card and overdraft liabilities! Would there be any chance to enhance my credit score in the subsequent 6-12 months to a point where I could secure a 0% balance transfer or a consolidation loan? Don't allow this to distract from your main objective of advancing your financial standing. Pursuing debt consolidation won't support the goals you've outlined such as obtaining a house or reaching financial stability. If you take to heart this advice, by the time you qualify for such an option, the benefit in interest savings may not outweigh the trouble involved. Prioritise the more challenging matters and clear your balances. Is this feasible, or am I set up for a more drawn out battle? Your situation involves a genuine struggle. If it was straightforward, you wouldn't need to ask! Your actions will ultimately determine the duration: based on how intensely you're willing to moderate your lifestyle, take on supplementary work, and impose extra payments on your debts. By adopting this stern approach, you will start to see advancement, providing motivation. If you're less than fully committed, your progress will reflect it and lead to disappointment. A considerable part of your success will hinge on your determination and emotional resilience to endure the rigours of putting off instant gratification and clearing these balances. This is simply my personal viewpoint, so feel free to take it or leave it. :) The credit score will naturally improve if you adhere to this strategy, so don't let it stress you. Best of luck!\n",

      "Reference Response:  The actual price is represented on charts and not the change in price as a percentage, because it is the actual price which is used in all other parts of analysis (both technical and fundamental), and it is the actual figure the security is bought and sold at. A change in price has to be relative to a previous price at a previous time, and we can easily work out the change in price over any given time period. I think what you are concerned about is how to compare a certain actual price change in low priced securities to the same actual price change in a higher priced securities.  For example: $1.00 rise in a $2.00 stock representing a 50% increase in price; $1.00 rise in a $10.00 stock representing a 10% increase in price. On a standard chart both of these look the same, as they both show a $1.00 increase in price. So what can we do to show the true representation of the percentage increase in price? It is actually quite simple. You view the chart using a log scale instead of a standard scale (most charting packages should have this option). What may look like a bubble on a standard scale chart, looks like a healthy uptrend on a log scale chart and represents a true picture of the percentage change in price. Example of Standard Price Scale VS LOG Price Scale on a Chart Standard Price Scale  On the standard scale the price seems to have very little movement from Mar09 to Jan12 and then the price seems to zoom up after Jan12 to Mar13. This is because a 4% increase (for example) of $0.50 is only $0.02, whilst a 4% increase of $7.00 $0.28, so the increases seem much bigger at the end of the chart. LOG Price Scale  On the LOG chart however, these price changes seem to be more evenly displayed no matter at what price level the price change has occurred at. This thus give a better representation of how fast or slow the price is rising or falling, or the size of the change in price.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Charts display actual prices, not the price changes in percentage terms as it's the actual price that's pivotal to all sections of analysis, both technical and fundamental. This is also the exact cost at which the security is bought and sold. Price variations need to be contextualized to an earlier price at a prior time, and the price change over any chosen timeframe is easily computed. It seems you're keen to know how to contrast an actual price alteration in low-cost securities to the equivalent actual price adjustment in pricier securities. For instance, a $1.00 increment in a $2.00 stock signifies a price rise of 50%, while a $1.00 hike in a $10.00 stock indicates a price growth of 10%. To a standard chart, these may look indistinguishable since they both depict a $1.00 price raise. How then, can we portray a truthful display of the price percentage increment? It's simpler than it appears. You switch the view of the chart to logarithmic scale rather than a standard one (this option should be available in most charting packages). What might seem like a bubble on a standard chart will look like a healthy ascendency on a log chart, thus providing an accurate portrayal of the percentage price shift. To illustrate, a Standard Price Scale chart would have minimal price mobility from Mar09 to Jan12 and then dramatic rise from Jan12 to Mar13. That's because a 4% leap from $0.50 is a mere $0.02, while the same percentage rise from $7.00 results in $0.28, so increases at the end of the chart appear much larger. However, a logarithmic Price Scale displays these price varies more equitably, regardless of the price level at which the change occured. It's therefore, a more suitable representation of the speed and size of the price changes.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Though it seems unintuitive, you should rationally ignore the past performance of this stock (including the fact that it's at its 52-week high) and focus exclusively on factors that you believe should affect it moving forward.  If you think it's going to go up even further,  more than the return on your other options for where to put the money, keep the stock.  If you think it's peaked and will be going down, now's a good time to sell. To put it another way: if you didn't already have this stock, would you buy it today? Your choice is just about the same: you can choose between a sum of cash equal to the present market value of the shares, OR the shares.   Which do you think is worth more? You also mentioned that you only have 10 stocks in the portfolio.  Some are probably a larger percentage than others, and this distribution may be different than what you want in your portfolio.  It may be time to do some rebalancing, which could involve selling some shares where your position is too large (as a % of your portfolio) and using the proceeds toward one or more categories you're not as invested in as you would like to be.  This might be a good opportunity to increase the diversity in your portfolio. If part of your reward and motivation for trading is emotional, not purely financial, you could sell now, mark it as a \"win,\" and move on to another opportunity.  Trading based on emotions is not likely to optimize your future balance, but not everybody is into trading or money for money's sake.  What's going to help you sleep better at night and help boost your quality of life?  If holding the stock will make you stress and regret a missed opportunity if it goes down, and selling it will make you feel happy and confident even if it still goes up more (e.g. you interpret that as further confirming that you made a good pick in the first place), you might decide that the risk of suboptimal financial returns (from emotion-based trading) is acceptable.  As CQM points out, you could also set a trailing sell order to activate only when the stock is a certain percentage or dollar amount below whatever it peaks at between the time you set the order and the time it fires/expires; the activation price will rise with the stock and hold as it falls.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Although it might sound counterintuitive, it's wise to overlook the previous performance of this particular stock, including its current high point over the last 52 weeks. Instead, keep your attention strictly on what you perceive to be the influences affecting its future. If you believe it's set to climb even further, surpassing the return on other potential investments, then hold on to it. However, if you predict it to have reached its zenith and foresee a downturn, selling now would be beneficial. A different perspective could be asking: If you didn't already own these shares, would you purchase them today? It boils down to you having a choice between a cash amount equivalent to the current market value of your shares or retaining the shares themselves - what do you perceive to hold more value? Also, you stated you only hold 10 stocks in your portfolio. Some of these are likely larger than the rest and the allocation may differ from your envisioned portfolio. Therefore, rebalancing may be the next step needed which might involve selling shares where your holding is overrepresented in proportion to your portfolio. This could potentially be an opportunity to introduce more variety to your initial portfolio. If your trading motivations are not strictly financial but also emotional, selling now and considering it as a \"victory\" to move on to the next opportunity might be suitable to you. Trading driven by emotions doesn't promise optimal future financial returns, but not everyone trades purely for financial gain. What's important is what lets you sleep soundly at night and boost your overall life quality. If sticking to your stock makes you stressed and regret missing other opportunities should it fall in the future and conversely if deciding to sell it brings happiness and confidence even if it continues to escalate (i.e., you consider it as a testament that your initial decision was right), you might accept the risk involved with an emotional trading strategy. However, as CQM indicates, consider setting a trailing sell order that only comes into effect when the stock drops a certain percentage or dollar value from its peak during the period between when the order is placed and when it is executed or it expires; this activation price would then continue to climb with the stock, yet freeze as it starts falling.\n",

      "Reference Response:  If I held stock in these companies yesterday, would I have profited by these gains? No.  For DZSI, your 5 shares at $1.10 would now be 1 share at $5.50, so you would have the same total amount.  For SGY, they closed at $6.95, and opened at $32.80, so your five shares at $6.95 would now be one share at $32.80, so you would have actually lost money (not purely because of the split, but because the \"new\" shares are trading lower then the expected 1:5 split price).  A split in general does not affect market cap (how much your total shares are worth) but there may be residual effects that cause the market value to fluctuate after a split that affect the price.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Would I have made a profit if I had stocks in these companies from the day before? Negative. For instance, your five shares of DZSI, each priced at $1.10, would now condense to a single share priced at $5.50 and the total value remains unchanged. As for SGY, the situation is slightly worse, they wrapped up at $6.95 and commenced operations at $32.80. This would result in  your five shares, originally costing $6.95 each, becoming a single share valued at $32.80 meaning a loss rather than a gain (this is not solely due to the splits, but because the redefined shares are trading at a lesser rate than the expected 1:5 split cost). A split doesn't necessarily affect the market cap or the total worth of your shares although there might be subsequent impact causing the market value to oscillate leading to a variation in the price after the split.\n",

      "Reference Response:  It is basically the same situation what US was when the crash happened. People took on debt without the means to pay, even with awful credit records. But the problem isn't the debt people take on themselves, but with the limited disposable income they have how efficiently can their debts be serviced. And how do banks who lend out money can recover their money. When banks lend money to all and sundry, they have to take care of defaults and that is when financial wizardry comes into play. In US people have the option to default on their debt and refinance it, so banks assumed default and tried to hedge their risks. If this is an option in Australia, be ready for a crash else not to worry about much. If banks continue lending expect higher inflation rates, higher interest rates and maybe a downgrade of bonds issued by the Australian government. Higher import costs and a boom in exports because of devalued Australian dollar.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The situation mirrors the circumstances the US found itself in during the financial crash. Individuals took on loans they couldn't pay back, despite poor credit histories. The real issue, however, is not the debt that individuals accrue, but whether or not their available income can adequately cover debt repayments. Furthermore, there's a question of how banks that distribute loans can recoup their funds. When banks indiscriminately disburse loans, they have to account for possible defaults, and this is where financial cleverness comes into effect. In the US, people have the option to declare bankruptcy and restructure their debt, which led to banks factoring in this risk. If this possibility exists in Australia, prepare for a downturn, otherwise, there's not much cause for concern. If banks insist on maintaining their lending habits, anticipate escalated inflation and interest rates, and potentially a reduced rating on bonds issued by the Australian government. Prepare for increased import expenses and a surge in exports due to a depreciated Australian dollar.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The refund may offset your liability for the next year, especially if you are a Schedule \"C\" filer.  By having your refund applied to the coming year's taxes you are building a 'protection' against a potentially high liability if you were planning to sell a building that was a commercial building and would have Capital Gains. Or you sold stock at a profit that would also put you in the Capital Gain area.  You won a large sum in a lottery, the refund could cushion a bit of the tax. In short, if you think you will have a tax liability in the current year then on the tax return you are filing for the year that just past, it may be to your benefit to apply the refund.  If you owe money  from a prior year, the refund will not be sent to you so you will not be able to roll it forward.    One specific example is you did qualify in the prior year for the ACA.  If in the year you are currently in- before you file your taxes-- you realize that you will have to pay at the end of the current year, then assigning your refund will pay part or all of the liability. Keep in mind that the 'tax' imposed due to ACA is only collected from your refunds.  If you keep having a liability to pay  or have no refunds due to you, the liability is not collected from you.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Your refund could potentially counterbalance your tax obligations for the coming year, particularly if you're a Schedule \"C\" filer. By rolling this refund into the upcoming year's taxes, you're creating a safety net against possible large liabilities, such as if you intend to sell a commercial property with associated Capital Gains, or if you've profited from selling stocks that result in Capital Gains. Should you be lucky enough to win a large lottery prize, this refund could soften the tax impact partially. Essentially, if you foresee a tax obligation this year, it could be advantageous to reassign the refund on your tax return for the recent past year. If you're still in debt from a previous year, you won't receive the refund, thus making it impossible to carry forward. A specific instance is if you were eligible for the ACA in the previous year. If you find before filing your taxes for the current year that you'll have a pending payment at year's end, then transferring your refund could clear or reduce your total obligation. Remember, the \"tax\" charge related to the ACA is only collected via your refunds. If you continually owe taxes or don't have any refunds, the obligation isn't extracted from you.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Being a tax professional, my understanding is that the threshold limit is a single limit for all your source(s) of income. Now many people who already draw salary which is liable to tax, develop application for mobile and generate some income. Such income is liable to tax, if along with other income they exceed the threshold limit.  Income will have surely related expenses. And the expenses which are related to earning of the income are allowed to be deducted.\n",

Margin requirements are derived from the Federal Reserve, Self Regulatory Organizations, the exchange itself, the broker you use, and which margining system you are using.

It's important to remember that some ADRs (some European companies listed in US) have ADR fees which vary.

      "Reference Response:  people implicity agree to sell stocks when a company does bad But, remember, when you sell the stock of a company that, in your estimation, 'did bad', someone else had to buy; otherwise, there is no sale. The someone else who bought your shares evidently disagrees with your assessment. Did you sell because the company didn't earn a profit at all? Did it not earn a profit because it's in a dead-end business that is slowly but inevitably declining to zero? Something like Sears Holdings? Or did it not make a profit because it is in an emerging market that will possibly someday become hugely profitable? Something like Tesla, Inc.? Did you sell because the company made a profit, but it was lower than expected? Did they make a lower-than-expected profit because of lower sales? Why were the sales lower? Is the industry declining? Was the snow too heavy to send the construction crews out? Did the company make a big investment to build a new plant that will, in a few years, yield even higher sales and profits? What are the profits year-over-year? Increasing? Declining? Usually, investors are willing to pay a premium, that is more than expected, for a stock in a company with robust growth.  As you can see, the mere fact that a company reported a profit is only one of many factors that determine the price of the shares in the market.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  People typically choose to offload their shares when they perceive a company is underperforming. However, you must recall that for every stock sold there's a buyer, indicating differing opinions on the company's performance. You may have sold off because the company didn't make any profits—perhaps it's stuck in a stagnant or dying business sector, akin to Sears Holdings. Alternatively, the company might not have realized profits due to its engagement in a novel market with huge potential returns, much like Tesla, Inc. Perhaps you relinquished your shares not because the company wasn't profitable, but because the profits didn't meet expectations. Was this due to decreased sales? What led to this slump? Is it because the industry itself is diminishing? Was the weather too inclement for fielding the construction teams? Could it be that the company invested heavily in a new factory projected to significantly boost future sales and earnings? How have the profits been faring over the past years? On an upwards or downwards trajectory? Often, investors are keen on paying an extra amount for shares of a rapidly growing company.

      "Reference Response:  Before doing anything else: you want a lawyer involved right from the beginning, to make sure that something reasonable happens with the house if one of you dies or leaves. Seriously, you'll both be safer and happier if it's all explicit. How much you should put on the house is not the right question. Houses don't sell instantly, and while you can access some of their stored value by borrowing against them that too can take some time to arrange. You need to have enough operating capital for normal finances, plus an emergency reserve to cover unexpectedly being out of work or sudden medical expenses. There are suggestions for how much that should be in answers to other questions. After that, the question is whether you should really be buying a house at all. It isn't always a better option than renting and (again as discussed in answers to other questions) there are ongoing costs in time and upkeep and taxes and insurance. If you're just thinking about the financials, it may be better to continue to rent and to invest the savings in the market. The time to buy a house is when you have the money and a reliable income, plan not to move for at least five years, really want the advantages of more elbow room and the freedom to alter the place to suit your needs (which will absorb more money)...  As far as how much to put down vs. finance: you really want a down payment of at least 20%. Anything less than that, and the bank will insist you pay for mortgage insurance, which is a significant expense. Whether you want to pay more than that out of your savings depends on how low an interest rate you can get (this is a good time in that regard) versus how much return you are getting on your investments, combined with how long you want the mortgage to run and how large a mortgage payment you're comfortable committing to. If you've got a good investment plan in progress and can get a mortgage which charges a lower interest rate than your investments can reasonably be expected to pay you, putting less down and taking a larger mortgage is one of the safer forms of leveraged investing... IF you're comfortable with that. If the larger mortgage hanging over you is going to make you uncomfortable,  this might not be a good answer for you. It's a judgement call. I waited until i'd been in out of school about 25 years before I was ready to buy a house. Since i'd been careful with my money over that time,  I had enough in investments that I could have bought the house for cash. Or I could have gone the other way and financed 80% of it for maximum leverage. I decided that what I was comfortable with was financing 50%. You'll have to work thru the numbers and decide what you are comfortable with. But I say again, if buying shared property you need a lawyer involved. It may be absolutely the right thing to do ... but you want to make sure everything is fully spelled out... and you'll also want appropriate terms written into your wills. (Being married would carry some automatic assumptions about joint ownership and survivor rights... but even then it's safer to make it all explicit.) Edit: Yes, making a larger down payment may let you negotiate a lower interest rate on the loan. You'll have to find out what each bank is willing to offer you, or work with a mortgage broker who can explore those options for you.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  First things first, having a lawyer's guidance right from the start is fundamental to ensure a fair division of the house property should one party depart or pass away. You'll both feel more secure and satisfied if all terms are clearly laid out. The question is not, \"how much should be invested in the house?\", as house sales can be time-consuming, and even borrowing funds against them may take a while to organise. Normal financial operating capital, along with an emergency fund to cover unexpected unemployment or medical expenses, is a must. Guidelines on the appropriate amounts can be found answering other queries. Following that, you should reflect on whether purchasing a house is the best move. Home ownership is not always superior to renting, considering the associated costs for maintenance, taxes, and insurance. If you're primarily concerned about finances, renting and investing the saved money in the market might be the smarter choice. The suitable time to purchase a house is when you have a steady income, assurance of not moving for at least five years, and a desire for more space and customisation freedom, which will require additional expenditures.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Concerning the down payment vs. the loan amount, the goal should be a minimum of 20% down payment. Less than this, and you'll be obliged to finance mortgage insurance, which is a hefty charge. The decision to pay more upfront will depend on the interest rate you're offered, the returns on your investments, the mortgage term you desire, and the mortgage payment you're willing to accept. If you have a robust investment plan with a mortgage interest rate lower than your potential investment returns, a larger mortgage could be a safe form of leveraged investment, but only if you feel comfortable with it. If a bigger mortgage will cause anxiety, it may not be the right choice. It's basically a matter of personal judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I, for instance, didn't consider buying a home until approximately 25 years post graduation. My prudent savings over those years provided me with sufficient investment capital to potentially pay my abode in cash. Alternatively, I could have opted to finance 80% of it for optimal leverage. My comfort zone was to finance 50% of it. The numeric crunching and comfort zone will vary with each individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, when it comes to jointly purchasing property, legal counsel is essential. Although it might be the wise choice, all terms should be explicitly defined, including provisions written in your wills. Marriage may imply certain presumptions regarding joint proprietorship and survivor rights, but it's always safer to state all terms explicitly. Lastly, paying a larger down payment might enable you to negotiate a lower interest rate on the loan, so find out the best offer each bank is willing to provide or seek assistance from a suitable mortgage broker.\n",

In fact, I had two savings accounts, and Well Fargo closed one of them because I hadn't used it in years. Downsides of savings accounts: You are limited to 5 transfers per month into or out of them. No such limit with checking. Upsides of savings accounts: Well, maybe you will be less likely to spend the money. Why don't you just have your pay go into your checking and then just transfer \"extra money\" out of it, rather than the reverse? If you want to put money \"away\" so that you save it, assuming you're in the U.S.A., open a traditional IRA. Max deposit of $5500/year, and it reduces your taxable income. It's not a bad idea to have a separate account that you don't touch except for in an emergency. But, for me, the direction of flow is from work, to checking, to savings.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Essentially, I utilize my checking account exclusively. Are there any disadvantages to this? Savings accounts offer a higher interest rate than checking accounts. However, the interest rates have been almost nil for about a decade now. Because of this, there's barely any advantage to retaining money in a savings account. For example, I possessed two savings accounts, but Wells Fargo ended up closing one of them due to my extended period of inactivity. Drawbacks of savings accounts include a restriction to five monthly transactions, a limitation that is non-existent with checking accounts. On the bright side, having a savings account might curb your spending habits. How about directing your salary to your checking account and only shifting excess funds, instead of doing it the other way around? If your goal is to stash money aside for savings, assuming you're based in the U.S.A., you could consider opening a traditional IRA. There's a maximum contribution of $5500 per year, and it lowers your taxable income. Having a separate account for emergencies that you do not dip into regularly isn't a bad idea. However, for me, the money flow is primarily from work, to checking, and then savings.\n",

In general, banks won't accept \"large\" stale checks. The meaning of \"large\" varies -- $25,000 in NYC, as little as $2k in other places. Banks that service high-volume check issuers (like rebate companies) reject checks at 180 days. For business purposes, I think some banks will create accounts for specific mailings or other purposes as well. (i.e. 2011 refund account) The accounts close after a year.\n",

Financial institutions catering to businesses that issue checks in high volumes, such as refund companies, often decline checks at the 180-day mark. For business activities, it's likely that some banks set up accounts for specific mailings or similar uses, like a 2011 refund account, for instance.

      " “Why do governments borrow money instead of printing it? (When printing money, one doesn't need to pay interest).”  Good question.  Numerous leading economists, including a couple of economics Nobel Laureates have asked the same question and concluded that borrowing can be dispensed with. First, Milton Freidman set out a monetary system in a paper in the American Economic Review which involved no government borrowing, and govt just printed money (in a responsible fashion of course) as and when needed.  See: http://www.jstor.org/pss/1810624 A second Nobel Laureate with similar views was William Vickrey. A third economist with similar views (of Keynes’ era) was Abba Lerner. Keynes said of Lerner, “Lerner's argument is impeccable, but heaven help anyone who tries to put it across to the plain man at this stage of the evolution of our ideas”.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  \"Why is it that governments borrow money when they could simply print more of it without having to pay any interest?\" This is a compelling inquiry. Several reputable economists, including a few winners of the Nobel in Economics, have posed the same thought-provoking question, concluding that there is no absolute necessity for governments to borrow money. To illustrate, Milton Freidman once proposed a theoretical monetary system devoid of government borrowing, where the government could emit money responsibly whenever necessary in an article for the American Economic Review. His argument can be seen here: http://www.jstor.org/pss/1810624. William Vickrey, another Nobel recipient, shares similar perspectives. Abba Lerner, a contemporary of Keynes, also held comparable views. Keynes once expressed about Lerner's standpoint, stating, \"Lerner's reasoning is irrefutable, but I fear for anyone endeavoring to communicate it to a layperson in our current cognitive epoch.\"\n",

Edited: The definition of the word in this case meaning \"something used or serving to point out; a sign, token, or indication\" from Meaning  #3 I presume therefore you are asking what an index is? There are many variations of what makes up an Index but in short it is a representation of some part of a market. An extremely simplistic calculation would be to take a basket of stocks, and sum their prices.  If one stock moves up a dollar, and one moves down a dollar, the index has effectively not changed, as it is presumed that the loss in one is offset by the gain in the other.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The term you're asking about, index, in this context refers to \"something that identifies or indicates,\" based on its third definition. So, you're possibly questioning the function of an index? The index could have various forms, but essentially, it symbolizes a certain segment of the market. A basic and easy-to-understand calculation would be to total the prices of a group of stocks. If the price of one stock increases by a dollar while another diminishes by the same amount, the overall index remains unaltered—reason being, the increment in one stock is thought to compensate for the decrement in the other.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Congratulations for achieving an important step in the road to financial freedom. Some view extending loan payment of loans that allow the deduction of interest as a good thing. Some view the hit on the credit score by prematurely paying off an installment loan as a bad thing.  Determining the order of paying off multiple loans in conjunction with the reality of income, required monthly living expense, and the need to save for emergencies is highly individualized.  Keeping an artificial debt seems to make little sense, it is an expensive insurance policy to chase a diminishing tax benefit and boost to a credit score. Keep in mind it is a deduction, not a credit, so how much you save depends on your tax bracket.  It might make sense for somebody to extend the loan out for an extra year or two, but you can't just assume that that advice applies in your situation. Personally I paid off my student loan early, as soon as it made sense based on my income, and my situation. I am glad I did, but for others the opposite made more sense.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Kudos on reaching a significant milestone towards financial independence. Some people consider prolonging the repayment of loans, which offer an interest deduction, to be beneficial. Others perceive a hit on the credit score due to an early repayment of an installment loan as unfavorable. Deciding the sequence of repaying numerous loans, in sync with one's income, essential monthly living expenses, and emergency savings necessity, is a very personal decision. Maintaining a false debt seems illogical since it's merely an expensive precaution taken to tap into a dwindling tax benefit and elevate a credit score. Do remember it's a deduction, not a credit, so your savings heavily depend on your tax bracket. It could be reasonable for someone to stretch the loan for an additional year or two, but it isn't obvious that this advice suits your context. I, for one, paid off my student loan ahead of schedule, as soon as it seemed feasible based on my income and circumstances. I am pleased with my choice, but for some others, the opposite approach was more logical.\n",

      "Reference Response:  It totally depends on when your expenses hit and whether you might have a larger stock than necessary. If you run your projections against the monthly save and the intervals of when you'll need the money, you might be able to extract some stock from the account.  I recommend making this a bit simpler. I operate this with an \"annuals\" account which is a complete aggregate of expenses that I know I have several times per year (or once every two years), but are not monthly or part of a weekly non-fixed expense budget cap. Instead of tracking each expense individually and saving for it, create a spreadsheet that lists out all of these expenses, sum them, and then divide by 12. When I first opened this account, I added a one-time deposit to \"catchup\" to make sure I would never need to pull money from another source for these expenses. As new expenses come into existence that I should plan for annually, I simply add them to this list and adjust the monthly auto-deposit to the account. This also adjusts my single number weekly budget.  To make it easy, whenever I see an expense on my annuals list on my amex or debit, I simply initiate a withdrawal from the annuals savings and it will balance out my weekly or monthly budget expenses.  The goal of my annuals account is to simply avoid anti-windfalls that are known quantities (insurance, annual eye exam, sprinkler flush, amazon prime, etc) that would throw a wrench in weekly/monthly budget and expense planning. The more variables you can remove from your weekly/monthly, the more regular it becomes and the more likely you will be able to stick to a budget.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The ability to manage your funds hinges on the timing of your expenses and potentially having more stock than needed. By projecting your savings monthly and identifying the intervals when you'll require money, you may be able to generate some capital from your account reserves. Simplifying this process can greatly benefit your financial management. I do this through an \"annuals\" account, where I compile all the recurring costs I encounter various times throughout the year (or every two years), which aren't part of my normal weekly or monthly expenses. Rather than monitoring each cost singularly, develop a spreadsheet that itemizes all these expenses, tally them, then break down that number by 12. When I initially set up this account, I used a one-time deposit to ensure I couldn't be caught short for these particular expenses. I simply add any new expenses I need to budget for annually and alter the automatic monthly deposit accordingly. This also modifies my singular weekly budget figure. For ease, anytime I see an charge that is on my annuals list, I initiate a withdrawal from my annual savings which keeps my budget balanced. The essential purpose of my annuals account is to circumvent any known financial obstacles (e.g. insurance, yearly eye exams, sprinkler maintenance, Amazon Prime subscription) that could disrupt my budgeting. By eliminating as many variables from your budgets as possible, they become more consistent and manageable, allowing you to stick to your financial plans.\n",

      "Reference Response:  1. Interest rates What you should know is that the longer the \"term\" of a bond fund, the more it will be affected by interest rates. So a short-term bond fund will not be subject to large gains or losses due to rate changes, an intermediate-term bond fund will be subject to moderate gains or losses, and a long-term bond fund will be subject to the largest gains or losses. When a book or financial planner says to buy \"bonds\" with no other qualification, they almost always mean investment-grade intermediate-term bond funds (or for individual bonds, the equivalent would be a bond ladder averaging an intermediate term). If you want technical details, look at the \"average duration\" or \"average maturity\" of the bond fund; as a rough guide, if the duration is 10, then a 1% change in interest rates would be a 10% gain or loss on the fund. Another thing you can do is look at long-term (10 years or ideally longer) performance history on some short, intermediate, and long term bond index funds, and you can see how the long term funds bounced around more. Non-investment-grade bonds (aka junk bonds or high yield bonds) are more affected by factors other than interest rates, including some of the same factors (economic booms or recessions) that affect stocks. As a result, they aren't as good for diversifying a portfolio that otherwise consists of stocks. (Having stocks, investment grade bonds, and also a little bit in high-yield bonds can add diversification, though. Just don't replace your bond allocation with high-yield bonds.) A variety of \"complicated\" bonds exist (convertible bonds are an example) and these are tough to analyze. There are also \"floating rate\" bonds (bank loan funds), these have minimal interest rate sensitivity because the rate goes up to offset rate rises. These funds still have credit risks, in the credit crisis some of them lost a lot of money. 2. Diversification The purpose of diversification is risk control. Your non-bond funds will outperform in many years, but in other years (say the -37% S&P 500 drop in 2008) they may not. You will not know in advance which year you'll get. You get risk control in at least a few ways. There's also an academic Modern Portfolio Theory explanation for why you should diversify among risky assets (aka stocks), something like: for a given desired risk/return ratio, it's better to leverage up a diverse portfolio than to use a non-diverse portfolio, because risk that can be eliminated through diversification is not compensated by increased returns. The theory also goes that you should choose your diversification between risk assets and the risk-free asset according to your risk tolerance (i.e. select the highest return with tolerable risk). See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory for excruciating detail. The translation of the MPT stuff to practical steps is typically, put as much in stock index funds as you can tolerate over your time horizon, and put the rest in (intermediate-term investment-grade) bond index funds. That's probably what your planner is asking you to do. My personal view, which is not the standard view, is that you should take as much risk as you need to take, not as much as you think you can tolerate: http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ But almost everyone else will say to do the 80/20 if you have decades to retirement and feel you can tolerate the risk, so my view that 60/40 is the max desirable allocation to stocks is not mainstream. Your planner's 80/20 advice is the standard advice. Before doing 100% stocks I'd give you at least a couple cautions: See also:\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  1. Regarding the Impact of Interest Rates: It's vital to understand that the effect of interest rates on a bond fund increases proportionally with its term length. Therefore, a bond fund with a short term won't see significant gains or losses from interest rate fluctuations, while those with an intermediate term will experience moderate changes. The ones with a long term, however, will undergo the most substantial gains and losses. When financial advisors refer to \"bonds\" without specifications, they typically imply investment-grade, intermediate-term bond funds, similar to an average bond ladder for individual bonds. You can gain more insight by reviewing the bond fund's \"average duration\" or \"average maturity.” Roughly, if the duration is 10, a 1% shift in interest rates corresponds to a 10% gain or loss on the fund. It is also beneficial to examine the long-term performances of short, intermediate, and long-term bond index funds, noting that long-term funds usually have more volatile histories. Non-investment-grade bonds, also known as junk bonds or high yield bonds, largely depend on elements other than interest rates, including factors that can influence stocks. Therefore, they are less effective for diversifying a stock-heavy portfolio. Nonetheless, a balanced mix of these bonds can contribute to portfolio diversification. Beware of other more complex bonds like convertible bonds and floating rate bonds; they're challenging to assess and come with additional credit risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Discussing Diversification: The goal of diversification is to manage risk. While your non-bond funds may perform well in certain years, they are less likely to outperform in times of economic downturns, such as the -37% S&P 500 slump in 2008. Unknown future returns necessitate risk management. Academic frameworks, like Modern Portfolio Theory, recommend diversifying among risky assets like stocks. The theory argues that for a specific risk/return ratio, leveraging a diverse portfolio is more effective than relying on a non-diverse one since diversification can eliminate certain risks without cutting into returns. It's advisable to establish a balance between risky assets and risk-free assets based on your level of risk tolerance. \n",
      "\n",
      "Practically, it often translates to investing as much as you can handle in stock index funds over the long term and allocating the remaining to intermediate-term investment-grade bond index funds. Your planner is likely suggesting this route. However, I hold a dissimilar view, contrary to popular opinion, which suggests taking only necessary risks, not merely what you consider tolerable. But many might still advise an 80/20 split if you're a few decades away from retirement and willing to shoulder the risk, making my viewpoint of a max 60/40 allocation to stocks rather unconventional. The suggested 80/20 strategy is normally recommended. Moving to 100% stocks comes with a warning: there's additional risk involved, so proceed cautiously.\n",

      "Reference Response:  One reason for this is that many people don't simply allow their houses to rot and decay. If you're talking about a house built in 1980 and left vacant and unmaintained for 35 years, it probably will be in pretty poor shape.  But a homeowner generally wants to preserve their house and maintain it in good condition, so they invest in things like new roofs, siding, gutters, windows, paint, exterminators, new furnaces, hot water heaters, air conditioners, etc... All this stuff costs money (and for tax purposes, can often be factored into the cost basis of the house when it is sold), but it maintains the value of the property. A small hole in the roof may be fairly cheap to fix, but if left unrepaired, it could eventually cause much of the building to rot, making the structure near worthless. If a car slams into your living room, you don't generally leave it there; most people repair the damage.  It's not uncommon in some areas to have 100 year old houses (or 300+ year old houses in some countries) that were built well in the first place and have been well maintained in the interim.  People also renovate their homes, ripping out outdated construction and appliances and sometimes building new additions, decks, porches, etc... This also serves to make the property more attractive and increases its value.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  This situation can be attributed to the fact that many individuals do not let their homes simply deteriorate over time. Consider a structure built in 1980 that was deserted and left without care for 35 years, its condition would likely be quite deplorable. However, a homeowner typically takes measures to keep their residence in prime condition by investing in new roofs, sidings, gutters, windows, and paint jobs as well as exterminator services and new heating systems, water heaters, and air conditioners. These investments, which can be utilized for tax deduction purposes when the property is sold, aid in the preservation of the property's value. An inexpensive repair like fixing a small hole in the roof can prevent the entire building from rotting and becoming virtually valueless, if left untreated. If an accident occurs, such as a car crashing into your house, it's usual to have it repaired instead of leaving it as is. In some regions, it's not uncommon to find houses that were built over a century ago, or even older in some nations, which were initially constructed with a strong foundation and have been maintained well over the years. Renovations are also common, such as discarding old fittings, improving the property with newer structures, decks, or verandas, all of which increase the house's appeal and value.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Generally, a one time thing is considered a gift. For the donor this is obviously not a deductible expense, except for some specific cases (for example promotional gifts under $25 to vendors can be deducted, if you're a business, or charitable contributions to a recognized charity). However, if this is a regular practice - that would not be considered as a gift, but rather as a tax fraud, a criminal offense. Being attentive I would like to make a little gift or give some little   (<100$) amount of money (cash/wire/online) for that Why? Generally, gift is exempt from income if no services were provided and the gift was made in good faith. In the situation you describe this doesn't hold. When the gift is exempt from income to the receiver - the donor pays the tax (in this case, below exemption the tax is zero). If the gift is not exempt from income to the receiver - it is no longer a gift and the receiver is paying income taxes, not the donor. The situation you describe is a classic tax evasion scheme. If someone does it consistently and regularly (as a receiver, donor, or both) - he would likely end up in jail.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Usually, a one-off act is seen as a present. As a giver, it's clearly not a tax-deductible expense, except in certain specific instances (like business promotional presents under $25 to vendors, or donations to an approved charity). Yet, if it becomes a habit, it's no longer perceived as a gift, but as tax evasion, a criminal act. Since I am careful, I would prefer to make a small gift or donate a minor amount of money (less than $100 in cash, bank transfer, or online). Why is that? Normally, a gift isn't subject to income if it was given in good faith and no services were supplied. In your case, this falls apart. If a gift is not subject to income for the recipient, the giver takes on the tax liability (which is nil in this case, beneath the exemption). If it isn't exempt from income for the recipient, it stops being a gift and the receiver pays income tax, not the donor. The situation you describe epitomizes tax fraud. If regularly employed (by the donor, recipient, or both), it could likely result in a prison sentence.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I don't know why stocks in some industries tend to have lower prices per share than others. It doesn't really matter much. Whether a company has 1,000,0000 shares selling for $100 each, or 10,000,000 shares selling for $10 each, either way the total value is the same. Companies generally like to keep the share price relatively low so that if someone wants to buy a small amount, they can. Like if the price was $10,000 per share, than an investor with less than $10,000 to put in that one stock would be priced out of the market. If it's $10, then if someone wants $10 they can buy one share, and if someone wants $10,000 they can buy 1000 shares. As to why energy stocks are volatile, I can think of several reasons. One, in our current world, energy is highly susceptible to politics. A lot of the world's energy comes from the Middle East, which is a notoriously unstable region. Any time there's conflict there, energy supplies from the region become uncertain. Oil-producing countries may embargo countries that they don't like. A war will, at the very least, interfere with transportation and shipping, and may result in oil wells being destroyed. Etc. Two, energy is consumed when you use it, and most consumers have very limited ability to stockpile. So you're constantly buying the energy you need as you need it. So if demand goes down, it is reflected immediately. Compare this to, say, clothing. Most people expect to keep the same clothes for years, wearing them repeatedly. (Hopefully washing them now and then!) So if for some reason you decided today that you only need three red shirts instead of four, this might not have any immediate impact on your buying. It could be months before you would have bought a new red shirt anyway. There is a tendency for the market to react rather slowly to changes in demand for shirts. But with energy, if you decide you only need to burn 3 gallons of gas per week instead of 4, your consumption goes down immediately, within days. Three, really adding to number two, energy is highly perishable, especially some forms of energy. If a solar power station is capable of producing 10 megawatts but today there is only demand for 9 megawatts, you can't save the unused megawatt for some future time when demand is higher. It's gone. (You can charge a battery with it, but that's pretty limited.) You can pile up coal or store natural gas in a tank until you need it, but you can't save the output of a power plant. Note numbers two and three also apply to food, which is why food production is also very volatile.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I'm unsure why shares in distinct industries tend to have varied price points. Nevertheless, this isn't of much consequence, as the ultimate company value remains persistent, whether it distributes a million shares at $100 each, or ten million shares at $10. Often, companies prefer maintaining lower share prices to facilitate investment from individuals wanting a nominal stake. For example, a share valued at $10,000 may discourage investors with limited funding, while a share price of $10 accommodates all, allowing investment according to individual affordability. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the unpredictable nature of energy shares, several reasons come to mind. Firstly, in our current geopolitical landscape, energy's stability is heavily influenced by politics. Most global energy originates from the Middle East, infamous for its instability. Any political unrest could jeopardize energy deliveries from the Middle East. Overt aggression might lead to the destruction of oil wells, impacting production. Furthermore, oil-producing nations may use embargo strategies against adversary countries. Secondly, as energy is a consumable resource without significant stocking capabilities, market demand is immediate and consistent. A suitable analogy would be clothing: unlike energy, clothing is worn multiple times over years. In an event where someone decides to reduce their wardrobe size, demand decreases gradually over time as compared to an instant demand fall in energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, expanding on the preceding point, energy is extremely perishable, especially certain kinds. Consider a solar power plant with the capacity to produce 10 megawatts; if the demand is just for 9 megawatts, the remaining 1 megawatt gets wasted, with no means to store it for future use. Although methods such as charging a battery exist, these are restrictive. While it's possible to stockpile coal or store natural gas, the output from a power plant can't be preserved. Similar dynamics apply to food production, making it equally capricious.\n",

China has not demonstrated a significant regard for its citizens' property rights - displacing individuals from self-sustaining farms to construct towering residential buildings - thus, it's dubious whether a foreigner could anticipate considerable protection. The strength of the local property law should always be the primary factor when making any asset acquisition. Judging from all perspectives, China falls short in this aspect.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Look at the basic cost of the lease.  Option 1: keep the car for three years. Pay for repairs during that time then sell it for $7,000. Option 2: Sell the current car for $10,000. Lease a new car for three years. Assume no need for repairs during those three years. At the end of the three years return the car in return for $0. Cost of option 1 is $3000 plus repairs.  Cost of Option 2 is 36 months x monthly lease cost. The first $83 of the monthly lease cost is to cover the $3000 fixed cost of option 1. The rest of the monthly lease cost is to cover the cost of repairs. Also remember that some leases have a initial down payment due at signing, and penalties for condition, and excess mileage. The lease company may also require a higher level of insurance for the lease to cover their investment if you have an accident.  Plus If you fall in love with a different car two year from now, or your needs change you are locked in until the end of the lease period.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Examine the fundamental expense associated with the lease. There are two options to consider. Option 1 involves keeping the car for three years, bearing the cost of any repairs during that period and then selling it for $7,000. Option 2 suggests selling the current car for $10,000 and then leasing a new one for three years, with the assumption that no repairs will be needed during that time. At the end of the term, the car is returned for $0. The total cost of Option 1 would be $3,000 plus the cost of repairs. Option 2 costs are calculated as 36 months multiplied by the monthly lease cost. The initial $83 of the monthly lease is intended to cover the $3,000 fixed cost of Option 1, whereas the remaining lease cost accounts for repairs. Take into account that some leases may require an initial down payment at signing, and penalties may be applied for conditions and excess mileage. The leasing company might also demand a higher insurance level to safeguard their investment in case of an accident. Furthermore, be aware that if you end up liking a different car two years from now, or if your requirements change, you are bound to the lease until its expiration.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The important thing to realize is, what would you do, if you didn't have the call? If you didn't have call options, but you wanted to have a position in that particular stock, you would have to actually purchase it. But, having purchased the shares, you are at risk to lose up to the entire value of them-- if the company folded or something like that.  A call option reduces the potential loss, since you are at worst only out the cost of the call, and you also lose a little on the upside, since you had to pay for the call, which will certainly have some premium over buying the underlying share directly. Risk can be defined as reducing the variability of outcomes, so since calls/shorts etc. reduce potential losses and also slightly reduce potential gains, they pretty much by definition reduce risk. It's also worth noting, that when you buy a call, the seller could also be seen as hedging the risk of price decreases while also guaranteeing that they have a buyer at a certain price. So, they may be more concerned about having cash flow at the right time, while at the same time reducing the cost of the share losing in value than they are losing the potential upside if you do exercise the option. Shorts work in the same way but opposite direction to calls, and forwards and futures contracts are more about cash flow management: making sure you have the right amount of money in the right currency at the right time regardless of changes in the costs of raw materials or currencies. While either party may lose on the transaction due to price fluctuations, both parties stand to gain by being able to know exactly what they will get, and exactly what they will have to pay for it, so that certainty is worth something, and certainly better for some firms than leaving positions exposed. Of course you can use them for speculative purposes, and a good number of firms/people do but that's not really why they were invented.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The critical point to grasp is, what actions would you undertake if you didn't possess the call? If you were devoid of call options but aimed for a share in that specific stock, your only choice would directly buy it. However, once you've bought these shares, you expose yourself to a risk of losing the entire investment, especially if the company goes under or faces a similar situation. Owning a call option curtails this potential loss. Even though you only lose the price of the call at worst, you miss out slightly on potential gains as the call would have some surplus over the direct purchase of the underlying share. Risk is determined by the decrease in the variability of results, which implies that calls or shorts reduce potential losses and slightly trim down potential profits, they consequently reduce risk by definition. Another interesting fact to note is that when you purchase a call, the vendor can be seen as mitigating the risk of price reduction while also ensuring a buyer at a fixed price. They could possibly be more worried about obtaining cash flow when suitable, while simultaneously curtailing the cost of the share depreciating rather than missing out on any possible upside, should you decide to exercise the option. Shorts operate in an inverse manner to calls and forward and futures contracts primarily handle cash flow: confirming the right amount of money in the correct currency at an appropriate time despite shifts in raw material prices or currencies. While each party could suffer a loss due to price changes, they both reap benefits from knowing exactly what they receive and what they have to pay for it. There is value in this certainty, and it is usually preferable for some companies, rather than leaving positions vulnerable. Undoubtedly, these can be put to use for speculative purposes, and a fair number of companies or individuals do so, but it's not genuinely the reason for their creation.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Given that the 6 answers all advocate similar information, let me offer you the alternate scenario - You earn $60K and have an employer offering a 50% match on all deposits. All deposits. (Note, I recently read a Q&A here describing such an offer. If I see it again, I'll link).  Let the thought of the above settle in. You think about the fact that $42K isn't a bad salary, and decide to deposit 30%, to gain the full match on your $18K deposit. Now, you budget to live your life, pay your bills, etc, but it's tight. When you accumulate $2000, and a strong want comes up (a toy, a trip, anything, no judgement) you have a tough decision. You think to yourself, \"after the match, I am literally saving 45% of my income. I'm on a pace to have the ability to retire in 20 years. Why do I need to save even more?\"  Your budget has enough discretionary spending that if you have a $2000 'emergency', you charge it and pay it off over the next 6-8 months. Much larger, and you know that your super-funded 401(k) has the ability to tap a loan. Your choice to turn away from the common wisdom has the recommended $20K (about 6 months of your spending) sitting in your 401(k), pretax deposited as $26K, and matched to nearly $40K, growing long term.  Note: This is a devil's advocate answer. Had I been the first to answer, it would reflect the above.  In my own experience, when I got married, we built up the proper emergency fund. As interest rates fell, we looked at our mortgage balance, and agreed that paying down the loan would enable us to refinance and save enough in mortgage interest that the net effect was as if we were getting 8% on the money. At the same time as we got that new mortgage, the bank offered a HELOC, which I never needed to use. Did we somehow create high risk? Perhaps. Given that my wife and I were both still working, and had similar incomes, it seemed reasonable.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Considering that all of the 6 responses share similar advice, allow me to propose a different perspective. Let's say you're earning $60K and your employer offers a 50% match on all of your deposits. Every single one. (I once came across a question and answer here that depicted this very scenario. Should I come across it again, I'll provide the link). Let this proposition sink in. Realizing that $42K isn't a bad income, you decide to put in 30% in order to take full advantage of the $18K deposit match from your employer. From there, your financial strategy is set to cover your living expenses and bills within a tight budget. When you manage to save up about $2000 for a significant expense (be it a gadget, vacation, anything really, no judgment) you face a challenging decision. At the back of your mind, you figure, \"Since I'm saving an impressive 45% of my earnings post-match, I'm well on my way to retiring in two decades. Why am I pressured to save more?\" Your budget allows for some flexible spending and in the event of a $2000 'emergency', you incur the cost and slowly pay it off over the course of 6 to 8 months. Anything greater, and you're aware that your significantly increased 401(k) allows for a loan. Opting to diverge from popular opinion has lead to you having approximately $20K (roughly 6 months of your expenditure) in your 401(K). That's pre-tax deposits amounting to $26K, matched up to almost $40K, and continuously growing for the long term. Note: This scenario acts as a contrarian view. If I were the initial person to provide an answer, it would mirror this very scenario. From personal experience, upon getting married, my partner and I established an adequate emergency fund. As interest rates began to decline, we evaluated our mortgage balance and agreed that reducing the loan would allow us to refinance and realize savings in mortgage interest. The savings were so significant, it was as if we were earning an 8% return on our investment. Concurrently, as we secured a new mortgage, our bank provided us with a home equity line of credit, which we never needed to utilize. Is it possible we were taking on a high-risk scenario? Maybe, but considering my wife and I both maintained our careers with similar incomes, it seemed like a reasonable risk to take.\n",

No.  That would be absurdly expensive.  So, you hire an agent in NYC who will broker a deal for you in the exchange. Fast forward 100 years, to the time when instant communications is available.  Why do we now still need brokerages, when the Exchanges could set up web sites and let you do the trading? The answer is that the Exchanges don't want to have to develop the accounting systems to manage the transactions of hundreds of thousands of small traders, when existing brokerage firms already have those computerized processes in place and are opening their own web sites.

That's why you'd appoint an NYC-based agent to negotiate a deal for you at the exchange. Leap ahead a century to an era of immediate communication. Why do we still need broker services when Exchanges could establish online sites for personal trading? The reason lies in the fact that Exchanges prefer not to design transaction management systems for the vast number of individual traders, especially when existing brokerage firms have already computerized such functions, even launching their own websites.

(Note: due to how these are structured, they are only suitable for very short term investments) You can also consider using Put options for the various indices as well.  For example, you could buy a Put for the SPY out a year or so to give you some fairly cheap insurance (assuming it's a small part of your portfolio). One other option is to invest against the market volatility.  As the market makes sudden swings, the volatility goes up; this tends to be true more when it falls than when it rises.

      "Reference Response:  On the one hand, it's a great idea to open a Roth IRA now, once you've got the cash to contribute. It's a tax designation sounds like it would fit your meager earnings this year. The main reason to open one now rather than later is that some types of withdrawls require the account be aged 5 years. But you can also withdraw the amount you've contributed tax free any time. Student loans right now are pricey, so if you're carrying a balance at say 6.8 percent fixed you should pay that down ASAP. Beyond that, I'd keep the rest liquid for now. Having that kind of liquid cash is extremely reassuring, and many of the biggest returns on investment are going to be in your personal life. More fuel efficient vehicles, energy efficient appliances, computer backups, chest freezers and bulk meat purchases, etc.  One example I see every six months is car insurance: I can pay for six months in full or I can pay a smaller monthly bill plus a small fee. That fee is well above current market rates. You see this everywhere; people searching for lower minimum payments rather than lower total costs. Save your money up and be the smart buyer. It's too damn expensive to be broke.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Opting for a Roth IRA as soon as you have the required funds is an intelligent move, given your moderate income this year. It's the tax status that seems most suitable. The primary reason to establish one sooner rather than later is that certain withdrawals mandate a minimum five-year account duration. Moreover, you can access the sum you've deposited at any point, tax-free. Student loans are currently costly, so if your existing debt has a fixed rate of 6.8 percent, it would be wise to pay it off promptly. Apart from this, I suggest keeping the remaining cash easily accessible. It's quite comforting to have readily available funds, with the most significant returns often manifesting in your personal life. This includes investments such as fuel-efficient cars, energy-saving equipment, computer storage, large freezer units, and bulk meat buying, among other things. Car insurance payments made every half-year is an example I frequently encounter: I have the option of paying the total upfront or choosing smaller, recurrent payments with a service charge. However, this service fee significantly outweighs current market values. This behavior is widely observed; people prioritize lower periodic payments over minimized overall expenditure. Accumulate your savings and make sensible purchases. Being financially unstable is unjustifiably costly.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Given the state of the economy, and the potential of a rough near future for us recent grads (i.e. on/off work), I would recommend holding off on large purchases while your life is in flux.  This includes both a NEW car and purchasing a house. My short answer is: you need a reliable vehicle, so purchase a used car, from a major dealer (yes this will add a fairly high premium, but easier financing), that is 4-5 years old, or more.  Barring the major dealer purchase, be sure to get a mechanic to check out a vehicle, many will offer this service for a reasonable payment.  As people point out, cars these days will run for another 100k miles.  You will NOT have to pay anywhere near $27,000 for this vehicle.  You may need to leverage your 10k for a loan if you choose to finance, but it should not be a problem, especially as you seem to imply an established credit history. In addition to this, start saving your money for the house you would like to eventually get.  We have no idea where you live, but, picking rough numbers, assuming a 2 year buy period, 20% down, and a $250,000 home, the down payment alone will require you to save ~$2,000/month starting now. Barring either of these options, max out your money to tax sheltered accounts (your Roth IRA, work 401k, or a regular IRA) asap.  Obviously, do not deplete your emergency fund, if anything, increase it.  10k can be burned through in a heartbeat. Long Answer:  I purchased a brand new car, right out of school, at a reasonable interest rate.  Like you, I can afford this vehicle, however, if someone were to come to me today (3.5 years later) and offer me the opportunity to take it back and purchase a 4-5 year used vehicle, at a 4-5 year used car price, albeit at a much higher interest rate (since I financed), it would be about a 0.02 second decision. I like my car, but, I'd like the differential cash savings between it and a reliable used car more.  $27,000 is also fairly expensive for a new vehicle, there are many, very nice vehicles, for 21-23k.  I still would not consider these priced appropriate to spend your money on them, but they exist.  However, you do very much need a reliable vehicle, and I think you should get one. On the home front, your $400 all inclusive rent is insanely cheap.  Many people spend more than that on property tax and PMI each year, so anyone who throws the \"You're throwing money away!\" line at you is blowing smoke to justify their own home purchase.  Take the money you would have spent on a mortgage, and squirrel it away.  Do your own due diligence and research the home market in your area and decide for yourself if you think home prices have bottomed and will stay there, have further to go, or are going to begin to rise.  That is a decision only you can make for yourself. I'd add a section about getting expenses under control, but you said you could save 50% of your takehome pay.  This is an order of magnitude above the average.  Good job.  Try doing 50% for 4 months, then calculate your actual amount.  Then try to beat it.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Considering the current economic conditions and potential career instability for recent graduates like us, my advice would be to refrain from making significant purchases during this uncertain period. This applies to both buying a brand-new car and a house. Instead, you might consider purchasing a used vehicle that is 4-5 years old from a reputable dealer, although this does come with a higher premium due to easier financing arrangements. If you're not buying from a large dealer, ensure a mechanic inspects the car as many offer this service for a reasonable fee. Cars these days can last for an additional 100k miles. You don't need to spend close to $27,000 on this car. Your $10,000 could potentially be used as leverage for a loan, especially if your credit history is well established. At the same time, consider setting aside money for a house that you might want to buy down the line. We aren't sure of your location, but based on a hypothetical scenario of purchasing a $250,000 home within two years with a 20% down payment, you'd need to start saving roughly $2,000 per month. In the absence of these options, max out your investments in tax-sheltered accounts like a Roth IRA, a work 401k, or a standard IRA. Importantly, avoid depleting your emergency fund, and if possible, try to increase it since emergencies can occur unexpectedly and $10,000 can be used up quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Longer explanation: I bought a new car shortly after graduating at a fair interest rate. If given the chance today, 3.5 years later, I would consider trading in my new car for a reliable used one in a blink of an eye. Even though I'm fond of my car, I appreciate the cost difference between a new and used vehicle. Cars costing $27,000 are relatively steep, though there are desirable cars in the range of $21,000-$23,000. Still, I wouldn't advise spending your money on them, but getting a reliable vehicle is a necessity. Regarding housing, paying $400 in comprehensive rent is exceptionally economical. Many people spend more than that yearly just on property tax and PMI, so don’t let those who accuse you of \"wasting money\" sway you. Instead, save what you would have spent on mortgage payments. Do comprehensive research on the housing market in your area and make informed decisions about property values. Only you can make the right decision for your circumstances. Although you've mentioned that 50% of your income goes into savings, it's still worthwhile to monitor and manage your expenses diligently. Try maintaining this savings rate for four months, calculate the actual amount, and then set a new goal to exceed it.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Is there not some central service that tracks current currency rates that banks can use to get currency data? Sure.  But this doesn't matter.  All the central service can tell you is how much the rate was historically.  But the banks/PayPal don't care about the historical value.  They want to know the price that they'll pay when they get around to switching, not the last price before the switch.  Beyond that, there is a transaction cost to switching.  They have to pay the clearinghouse for managing the transaction.   The banks can choose to act as a clearinghouse, but that increases their risk.  If the bank has a large balance of US dollars but dollars are falling, then they end up eating that cost.  They'll only take that risk if they think that they'll make more money that way.  And in the end, they may have to go on the currency market anyway.  If a European bank runs out of US dollars, they have to buy them on the open market.  Or a US bank might run out of Euros.  Or Yen.  Etc.   Another problem is that many of the currency transactions are small, but the overhead is fixed.  If the bank has to pay $5 for every currency transaction, they won't even break even charging 3% on a $100 transaction.  So they delay the actual transaction so that they can make more than one at a time.  But then they have the risk that the currency value might change in the meantime.  If they credit you with $97 in your account ($100 minus the 3% fee) but the price actually drops from $100 to $99, they're out the $1.   They could do it the other way as well.  You ask for a $100 transaction.  They perform a $1000 transaction, of which they give you $97.  Now they have $898 ($1000 minus the $5 they paid for the transaction plus the $3 they charged you for the transaction).  If there's a 1% drop, they're out $10.98 ($8.98 in currency loss plus a net $2 in fees).   This is why banks have money market accounts.  So they have someone to manage these problems working twenty-four hours a day.  But then they have to pay interest on those accounts, further eating into their profits.  Along with paying a staff to monitor the currency markets and things that may affect them.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Doesn't a universal service exist for monitoring real-time currency rates that banks can utilize for accessing currency information? Indeed, it does. However, it's not really relevant. This service can only provide historical rates. But financial institutions and PayPal aren't bothered about the past figures. They're more interested in the rate they'll be charged when they decide to do a currency exchange, not the price just before the exchange. Moreover, there's a cost involved in exchanging currencies. Payment must be made to the clearinghouse for facilitating the transaction. Although banks can serve as clearinghouses, it heightens their risk. For instance, should a bank hold a large amount of falling US dollars, they incur the losses. They'll only gamble if they foresee greater profits. Ultimately, they may turn to the currency market. If a European bank runs dry of US dollars, they must purchase more on the open market. The same goes for American banks deficient in Euros and Yen, and so on. A further complication is that a lot of currency exchanges involve relatively small amounts, although the overhead remains constant. If a bank has to pay a standard $5 fee per transaction, charging 3% on a $100 transaction won't even allow them to break even. Consequently, they delay the actual transaction in order to do multiple ones simultaneously. But this strategy carries the risk of fluctuating currency rates. If your account is credited with $97 (subtracting the 3% fee from $100) but the price decreases to $99, the bank loses $1. It could be done differently, too. If you request a $100 transaction, they can make a $1000 transaction and give you $97. Then, they'll have $898 left (deducting the $5 transaction fee from $1000 and adding the $3 transaction fee they charged you). In case there's a 1% drop, they lose $10.98 ($8.98 from the currency loss and a net fee of $2). That's the reason banks have money market accounts, which allows them to have an around-the-clock currency manager. But then, they need to offer interest on these accounts which inversely affects their profits. Additionally, they bear the costs of employing a team to keep an eye on the global currency market and related factors.\n",

      "Reference Response:  For many people, giving to charity will have minimal effect on their taxes. Non-profits love to attract donations by saying the money is tax deductible, but for most people, it doesn't work out that way. You will only itemize deductions if they exceed your standard deduction. The IRS allows you to either \"itemize\" your deductions (where you list each deduction you can take) or take the \"standard deduction\". Consider a married couple filing jointly in 2011. Their standard deduction is $11,400. They are in the 28% tax bracket. They donate $100 of old clothes to the Goodwill, and are looking forward to deducting that on your taxes, and getting $28 of that back. If that's their only deduction, though, they'd have to give up the standard deduction to take the itemized deduction. Not worth it. Suppose instead they have $11,500 of deductions in 2011. Now we're talking, right? No. The tax impact of itemizing is only $28, since they only exceeded the standard deduction by $100. The cost of having a tax accountant fill out the itemization form probably offsets that small gain. There's also all the time that went in to tracking those deductions over the year. Not worth it.  Tax deductions only become worthwhile when they significantly exceed the standard deduction. You need some big ticket items to get past the itemized deduction threshold. For most people, this only happens when they have a mortgage, as the interest on a residence is deductible.  Folks love to suggest that having a mortgage is a good deal, because the interest is deductible. However, since you have to exceed the standard deduction before it makes sense to itemize, it's not likely to be a big win. For most people: TL;DR: Give to charity because you want that charity to have your money. Tax implications are minimal; let your accountant sort it out. Disclaimer: I am not an accountant.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  For a lot of individuals, making charitable donations will only insignificantly alter their tax situations. Charitable organizations often entice donors with the concept of tax deductions, but it doesn't really apply to everybody. You will only enumerate your deductions when they surpass your standard deduction. The IRS gives you the option to either \"enumerate\" your deductions (where you detail all eligible deductions) or simply take the \"standard deduction\". Take for instance a married couple who filed their taxes together in 2011. They have a standard deduction of $11,400 and are in the 28% tax bracket. They contribute $100 worth of used clothes to Goodwill, expecting to deduct that from their taxes and recoup $28. However, if that's their sole deduction, they'd need to forego their standard deduction to claim the itemized one. Not a good move. Let's say they have total deductions of $11,500 in 2011. Sounds good, right? Not really. The tax influence of itemizing is merely $28, as the standard deduction is exceeded only by $100. The amount charged by a tax accountant to prepare the itemized form likely nullifies this small gain. Additionally, a lot of time has been spent on keeping track of these deductions throughout the year. It's just not worth it. Tax deductions are only beneficial when they considerably surpass the standard deduction. You require some substantial expenses to cross the threshold for the itemized deduction. For most people, this situation is applicable only when they have a residential mortgage, as the interest is tax deductible. It is often suggested that having a mortgage is advantageous due to the deductible interest. Nevertheless, as it only makes sense to itemize when you exceed the standard deduction, it's probably not a huge benefit. In simpler terms for most people: Provide donations to charities because you genuinely want them to receive your funds. Tax consequences are minimal; leave that to your tax professional. Note: I am not a tax expert.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Theoretically, yes, you can only buy or sell whole shares (which is why you still have .16 shares in your account; you can't sell that fraction on the open market). This is especially true for voting stock; stock which gives you voting rights in company decisions makes each stock one vote, so effectively whomever controls the majority of one stock gets that vote. However, various stock management policies on the part of the shareholder, brokerage firm or the issuing company can result in you owning fractional shares. Perhaps the most common is a retirement account or other forward-planning account. In such situations, it's the dollar amount that counts; when you deposit money you expect the money to be invested in your chosen mix of mutual funds and other instruments. If the whole-shares rule were absolute, and you wanted to own, for instance, Berkshire Hathaway stock, and you were contributing a few hundred a month, it could take you your entire career of your contributions sitting in a money-market account (essentially earning nothing) before you could buy even one share. You are virtually guaranteed in such situations to end up owning fractions of shares in an investment account. In these situations, it's usually the fund manager's firm that actually holds title to the full share (part of a pool they maintain for exactly this situation), and your fractional ownership percentage is handled purely with accounting; they give you your percentage of the dividends when they're paid out, and marginal additional investments increase your actual holdings of the share until you own the whole thing. If you divest, the firm sells the share of which you owned a fraction (or just holds onto it for the next guy fractionally investing in the stock; no need to pay unnecessary broker fees) and pays you that fraction of the sale price.  Another is dividend reinvestment; the company may indicate that instead of paying a cash dividend, they will pay a stock dividend, or you yourself may indicate to the broker that you want your dividends given to you as shares of stock, which the broker will acquire from the market and place in your account. Other common situations include stock splits that aren't X-for-1. Companies often aren't looking to halve their stock price by offering a two-for-one split; they may think a smaller figure like 50% or even smaller is preferable, to fine tune their stock price (and thus P/E ratio and EPS figures) similar to industry competitors or to companies with similar market capitalization. In such situations they can offer a split that's X-for-Y with X>Y, like a 3-for-2, 5-for-3 or similar. These are relatively uncommon, but they do happen; Home Depot's first stock split, in 1987, was a 3-for-2. Other ratios are rare, and MSFT has only ever been split 2-for-1. So, it's most likely that you ended up with the extra sixth of a share through dividend reinvestment or a broker policy allowing fractional-share investment.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  On paper, it's generally true that you can only sell or buy complete shares of stock, which is why you have .16 shares remaining—you can't sell this partial share in the free trade market. This is particularly applicable to voting shares, which provide you with a vote in the company's decisions, effectively giving whoever has the majority of a share the voting power. But various policies by shareholders, the brokerage firm, or the company issuing the stocks may lead to you owning parts of shares. This is usually seen in retirement or other long-term financial planning accounts. Usually, it's about the total dollar amount in such cases; your money is expected to be invested in your chosen combination of mutual funds and other financial instruments when you deposit it. Without exceptions to the whole-share rule, if you aimed to own a stock like Berkshire Hathaway but were only able to make small monthly contributions, you might have to wait your entire career, with your funds parked in a non-interest bearing account, before you could purchase even one share. It's almost certain you'd end up owning partial shares in an investment account in these scenarios. Generally, the fund manager's firm will hold the complete share as part of a pool they manage specifically for this purpose, and your fractional ownership is managed entirely through accounting; you receive your share of dividends when they're paid, and any additional investments incrementally increase your ownership of the share until you fully own it. If you sell, the firm either sells or retains the share you partially owned (to avoid unnecessary broker expenses) and pays you a proportionate share of the selling price.  Another possibility is dividend reinvestment, where the company pays dividends in the form of stocks instead of cash or when you request your broker to reinvest your dividends as shares of stock. Other potential scenarios include non-standard stock splits. A company may not want to cut their stock price in half with a two-for-one split; they may prefer a lower figure, such as 50% or less, to align their stock price, P/E ratio, and EPS figures with industry competitors or firms with comparable market capitalizations. In these cases, they might offer a split such as a 3-for-2, 5-for-3, etc. They're not common, but they do occur; for example, Home Depot's initial stock split in 1987 was a 3-for-2. More diverse ratios are uncommon, with MSFT only ever splitting 2-for-1. Thus, it's highly probable that you got the additional sixteenth of a share through either dividend reinvestment or a brokerage policy that permits fractional-share investment.\n",

      "Reference Response:  If psychologically there is no difference to you between cash and debit (you should test this over a couple of months on yourself and spouse to make sure), then I suggest two debit cards (one for you and spouse) on your main or separate checking account. If you use Mint you can set budgets for each category (envelope) and when a purchase is made Mint will automatically categorize that transaction and deduct that amount from the correct budget.  For example: If you have a \"Fast Food\" budget set at $100 per month and you use the debit at McDonalds, Mint should automatically categorize it as \"Fast Food\" and deduct the amount from the \"Fast Food\" budget that you set.  If it can't determine a category or gets it wrong, you can just select the proper category. Mint has an iPhone (also Android and Windows phone) app that I find very easy to use. Many people state that they don't have this psychologically difference between spending cash and debit/credit, but I would say that most actually do, especially with small purchases.  It doesn't have anything to do with intellect or knowing that you are actually spending money.  It has more to do with tangibility, and the physical act of handing over cash.  You may not add that soda and candy bar to your purchase if you have visible cash in your wallet that will disappear more quickly.  I lived in Germany for 2 years before debit cards were around or common.  I'm a sharp guy and even though I knew that I paid $100 for the 152 DM, it still kind of felt like spending Monopoly money, especially considering that in the US we are used to coins normally being 25 cents or less and in Germany coins are up to 10 DM (almost $10) and are used more frequently than paper.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Should you find yourself in a situation where cash and debit do not psychologically differ for you (I'd advise you to verify this over a period of time with your partner), I would recommend procuring two debit cards (one each for you and your partner) linked to either your primary or a separate checking account. By making use of the Mint app, you can establish budgets for every category (or 'envelope') and every time you make a purchase, Mint will automatically classify the transaction and subtract the purchase cost from the pertinent budget. For instance, should you set a budget of $100/month for 'Fast Food' and use your debit card at McDonald's, Mint should auto-categorize it as 'Fast Food' and deduct that specific amount from your 'Fast Food' budget. If the app can't identify or miscategorizes a purchase, you can manually choose the right category. The Mint app, available on iPhone (also Android and Windows phone), is very user-friendly, according to my experience. \n",

No, actually what you are going to get out from this investment is after 10 years when this investment is mature for liquidation, you will get return not even your principle $100,000 , but ( (Principle $100,000) minus (Negative Yields @ -0.05) Times ( 10 Years ) ) assume the rates are on simple annual rate.  Now anyone may wander why should someone going to buy this kind of investment where I am actually giving away not only possible profit also losing some of principle amount!  This might looks real odd, but there is other valid reason for issuing / investing on such kind of bond.  From investor prospective: Every asset has its own 'expense' for keeping ownership of it. This is also true for money/currency depending on its size. And other investment possibility and risk factor. The same way people maintain checking account with virtually no visible income vs. Savings account where bank issue some positive rate of interest with various time factor like annually/half-yearly/monthly.

People with a steady yet low income prefer savings whereas business individuals prefer the checking option. Consider millions of uninvested money with no secure investment opportunity. The choices are to keep this large sum at hand, which comes with the hassle and risk of extra security measures, or to invest in bonds backed by the national government.

      "Reference Response:  You seem to have a little confusion over terminology that should be cleared up: You are calling this \"day-trading\" Day-trading is the term for performing multiple trading actions in a single day. While it appears that the COO has performed a buy and a sell on the same day, most people would consider this a 'single trade'. In reality, it seems that the COO had 'stock options' [a contract providing the option for the holder to buy stock at a specific price, at some point in the future], provided as part of his compensation package. He decided or was required to 'exercise' those options today. This means he bought the shares using his special 'option price'. It is extremely common for employees who exercise stock options, to sell all of the resulting stock immediately. This is very different from usual day-trading, which implies that he would have bought stock in the morning at a low price, and then sold it later at a high price. You are calling this 'insider trading'. That term specifically often implies some level of unethical behavior. In general, stock options offered to executive employees are strictly limited in how they can be exercised. For example, most stock option plans require employees to wait x number of years before they can exercise them. This gives the employee incentive to stay longer, and for a high-level executive with the ability to strongly impact company performance, it gives incentive to do well. Technically you are correct, this is likely considered an 'insider trade', but given that it seems to have been a stock option exercise, it does not necessarily imply that there was any special reasoning for why he did the trade today. It could simply be that today was the first day the stock option rules allowed him to exercise. As to your final question - no, these profits are the COO's, to do with as he likes.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  It appears there's a bit of misunderstanding with the terms you're using which needs to be addressed: You're referring to the events as a \"day-trading\". This phrase typically refers to conducting multiple trades within a day. Although our COO did carry out a purchase and sale on the same day, this action would usually be seen as a solitary trade. In fact, it's more likely that the COO was exercising 'stock options' [an agreement which offers the right to purchase shares at a specific price at a future date], which were part of his remuneration package. He either chose or was obligated to 'exercise' these options today, using his special 'option price' to buy the shares. It's quite usual for employees who exercise such stock options to immediately sell off the stock they just acquired. This is unlike the usual practice of day-trading, which would entail buying stock at a lower price in the morning and selling it for a higher price later. You're labeling this as 'insider trading', a term often associated with unethical conduct. Typically, stock options granted to executives come with strict guidelines regarding how they can be exercised. For instance, many stock option schemes necessitate employees to wait x number of years before they can exercise their options. This provides an incentive for the employee to stick around longer and, in the case of a high-level executive with significant influence on company performance, an incentive to perform well. While technically accurate, referring to this as an 'insider trade' doesn't necessarily mean there was a specific reason behind the timing of the trade. It's entirely possible that the rules of the stock option simply allowed for their exercise today. Regarding your ultimate question - the profits secured from the trade are indeed the COO's, to utilise as he sees fit.\n",

You have the cash to pay it off, but that may not be the optimal solution. You've got $85k in cash!  That's way too much. So your options are:  -Invest 40k -Pay 2.25% loan off -Prepay mortgage 40k Play around with this link: mortgage calculator Paying the student loan, and applying the $315 to the monthly mortgage reduces your mortgage by 8 years. It also reduces the nag factor of the student loan. Prepaying the mortgage (one time) reduces it by 6 years. (But, that reduces the total cost of the mortgage over it's lifetime the most) Prepaying the mortgage and re-amortizing it over thirty years (at the same rate) reduces your mortgage payment by $210, which you could apply to the student loan, but you'd need to come up with an extra $105 a month.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  From your figures, it appears that you're left with 12 years on your private student loan, which seems to be a hassle to me. You possess sufficient funds to clear it, but it might not be the best course of action. You're sitting on a cash amount of $85k, which is excessive! Hence, these are your possible paths - commit $40k to investments, pay off the 2.25% loan, or make an advance payment of $40k on your mortgage. You can experiment with this tool: mortgage calculator. Meeting the student loan repayment and allocating the $315 to the monthly mortgage reduces the mortgage term by 8 years. The irksome element of the student loan also diminishes. Making a lump-sum payment on the mortgage reduces its term by 6 years. However, this leads to the most considerable reduction in the mortgage's total cost throughout its tenure. Paying an amount on the mortgage and re-calculating it over a new 30-year term (at the same rate) lowers your monthly mortgage payout by $210. You could utilize this amount for the student loan, but you would need to find an additional $105 each month.\n",

      "Reference Response:  No. Credit card companies will typically not care about your individual credit card account. Instead they look either at a \"package\" of card accounts opened at roughly the same time, or of \"slices\" of cardholder accounts by credit rating. If an entire package's or slice's balance drops significantly, they'll take a look, and will adjust rates accordingly (often they may actually decrease rates as an incentive to increase you use of the card). Because credit card debt is unstructured debt, the bank cannot impose an \"early payment penalty\" of any kind (there's no schedule for paying it off, so there's no way to prove that they're missing out on $X in interest because you paid early). Generally, banks don't like CC debt anyway; it's very risky debt, and they often end up writing large balances off for pennies on the dollar. So, when you pay down your balance by a significant amount, the banks breathe a sigh of relief. The real money, the stable money, is in the usage fees; every time you swipe your card, the business who accepted it owes the credit card company 3% of your purchase, and sometimes more.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Generally, credit card companies don't pay much attention to individual card accounts. Instead, they focus on bundles of accounts that were opened around the same time or segments of cardholder accounts based on credit scores. If a whole bundle's or segment's balance significantly decreases, they'll investigate and may adjust rates accordingly. They might even lower rates to motivate you to use the card more. As credit card debt is unstructured, the banks can't charge an \"early payment penalty\" because there's no set timetable for repayment and thus no way to demonstrate the interest they'd lose if you paid before time. Generally speaking, banks aren't fond of credit card debt because it's a high-risk type of debt and they frequently have to write off large balances for a small portion of their value. So, when you decrease your balance significantly, banks take a sigh of relief. The true income, the reliable income, comes from usage fees; every instance you use your card, the store who took it has to pay the credit card company 3% of your purchase, sometimes even more.\n",

For example,  your lender might sell your mortgage to the highest bidder who may want to purchase your mortgage by making a one time payment.  For your lender that's a quick profit, for the new owner of your mortgage, that's long term returns for a one time fee.  For your lender, that is forgoing long term returns for short term gains (and transfer of risk in case you default).   (Very similar to how bonds work in a stock exchange!) What does this mean to you? Nothing.  You will still keep making payments to your original lender.   What does 'transfer of ownership has not been publicly recorded mean'? It means, when you are asked about ownership details regarding your mortgage, and this could be in tax forms or refinancing etc., you would enter your original lender's information and not Freddit Mac's! Pro-tip There are lots of scams based on this.  You might receive an official looking letter in mail claiming your loan has been sold and you should start making payments to the new owner.

      "Paraphrased Response:  Your mortgage might be sold by your lenders to other establishments for a price. It might be the case that your lending institution chooses to sell off your mortgage to the person willing to pay the highest amount, in a one-time transaction. This is a swift way for your lender to make a profit; conversely, for the new mortgage owner, it's a guaranteed return on their one-time investment. Your lender, in this process, substitutes potential long-term earnings for immediate benefits—and also shakes off the risk of you defaulting. This is not dissimilar from bond exchanges in stock trading. How does this affect you? Actually, it doesn’t. As per usual, you continue making payments to your initial lender. What if you see phrases like 'transfer of ownership has not been publicly recorded'? It means that, when inquiries about your mortgage ownership arise—perhaps on tax or refinance forms—you input your initial lender's data, not that of Freddit Mac's!

      "Reference Response:  They do but you're missing some calculations needed to gain an understanding. Intro To Stock Index Weighting Methods notes in part: Market cap is the most common weighting method used by an index.   Market cap or market capitalization is the standard way to measure the   size of the company. You might have heard of large, mid, or small cap   stocks? Large cap stocks carry a higher weighting in this index. And   most of the major indices, like the S&P 500, use the market cap   weighting method. Stocks are weighted by the proportion of their market cap to the total   market cap of all the stocks in the index. As a stock’s price and   market cap rises, it gains a bigger weighting in the index. In turn   the opposite, lower stock price and market cap, pushes its weighting   down in the index.  Pros Proponents argue that large companies have a bigger effect on the   economy and are more widely owned. So they should have a bigger   representation when measuring the performance of the market. Which is   true. Cons It doesn’t make sense as an investment strategy. According to a market   cap weighted index, investors would buy more of a stock as its price   rises and sell the stock as the price falls. This is the exact   opposite of the buy low, sell high mentality investors should use. Eventually, you would have more money in overpriced stocks and less in   underpriced stocks. Yet most index funds follow this weighting method. Thus, there was likely a point in time where the S & P 500's initial sum was equated to a specific value though this is the part you may be missing here. Also, how do you handle when constituents change over time? For example, suppose in the S & P 500 that a $100,000,000 company is taken out and replaced with a $10,000,000,000 company that shouldn't suddenly make the index jump by a bunch of points because the underlying security was swapped or would you be cool with there being jumps when companies change or shares outstanding are rebalanced? Consider carefully how you answer that question. In terms of histories, Dow Jones Industrial Average and S & P 500 Index would be covered on Wikipedia where from the latter link: The \"Composite Index\",[13] as the S&P 500 was first called when it   introduced its first stock index in 1923, began tracking a small   number of stocks. Three years later in 1926, the Composite Index   expanded to 90 stocks and then in 1957 it expanded to its current   500.[13] Standard & Poor's, a company that doles out financial information and analysis, was founded in 1860 by Henry Varnum Poor. In   1941 Poor's Publishing (Henry Varnum Poor's original company) merged   with Standard Statistics (founded in 1906 as the Standard Statistics   Bureau) and therein assumed the name Standard and Poor's Corporation.   The S&P 500 index in its present form began on March 4, 1957.   Technology has allowed the index to be calculated and disseminated in   real time. The S&P 500 is widely used as a measure of the general   level of stock prices, as it includes both growth stocks and value   stocks. In September 1962, Ultronic Systems Corp. entered into an agreement   with Standard and Poor's. Under the terms of this agreement, Ultronics   computed the S&P 500 Stock Composite Index, the 425 Stock Industrial   Index, the 50 Stock Utility Index, and the 25 Stock Rail Index.   Throughout the market day these statistics were furnished to Standard   & Poor's. In addition, Ultronics also computed and reported the 94 S&P   sub-indexes.[14] There are also articles like Business Insider that have this graphic that may be interesting: S & P changes over the years The makeup of the S&P 500 is constantly changing notes in part: \"In most years 25 to 30 stocks in the S&P 500 are replaced,\" said   David Blitzer, S&P's Chairman of the Index Committee. And while there   are strict guidelines for what companies are added, the final decision   and timing of that decision depends on what's going through the heads   of a handful of people employed by Dow Jones.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Indeed they do, but you're overlooking some key computations that would enhance your comprehension. It's noted within the 'Introduction To Stock Index Weighting Methods' that market capitalization, commonly referred to as market cap, is the predominant weighting method employed by an index. Often used to determine a company's size, you may be familiar with the terms large cap, mid cap, or small cap stocks. In this index, large cap stocks hold a greater weighting. This market cap weighting method is employed by majority of the significant indices like the S&P 500. The weighting of stocks is based on their market cap as compared to the total market cap of every stock in the index. If a stock’s price and its market cap increase, it gets an amplified weighting in the index. Conversely, a decrease in a stock's price and market cap reduces its weighting in the index.\n",
      "\n",
      "Supporters of this method argue that larger companies have a significant impact on the economy and are owned by a broader base of people, thus they should have a greater representation in market performance measurement. This argument holds some truth. However, as an investment strategy, it is flawed. It calls for buying more of a stock as its price goes up and selling as it decreases, contrary to the buy low, sell high principle that investors should adopt. Over time, this would result in an accumulation of overpriced stocks and a deficit in underpriced stocks and yet, most index funds abide by this method. \n",
      "\n",
      "At one point, it's probable that the sum of the S&P 500 was pegged to a specific value, but this is likely the piece you’re overlooking. More so, how would you manage changes in constituents as time progresses? For instance, if within the S&P 500, a $100 million company gets swapped for a $10 billion entity, this shouldn't spark a rapid rise in index points due to the change in the underlying security. Would you be comfortable with abrupt changes when companies vary or outstanding shares are balanced? Proceed cautiously in responding to that.\n",

The ultimate decision on additions follows strict guidelines and depends on the judgment of a select group of Dow Jones employees.\n",

For payments which have a lag, e.g. a cheque that needs to be paid in or a bank transfer that takes a few days, you might also need to choose between multiple payment dates, e.g. when you initiated the payment or when it took effect.

The Stochastic is not associated with price or volume; it's connected to speed.

When you fill them out and spend them, you are taking a cash advance on your credit card account.  You should be aware that taking a cash advance on your credit card normally has extra fees and finance charges above what you have with regular credit card transactions. That having been said, when you take one of these to your bank and try to deposit them, it is entirely up to bank policy how long they will make you wait to use these funds.  They want to be sure that it is a legitimate check and that it will be honored.  If your teller doesn't know the answer to that question, you'll need to find someone at the bank who does.  If you don't like the answer they give you, you'll need to find another bank.

However, bank policy doesn't always make sense.\n",

They want to verify the legitimacy of the check and the assurance of its honor. If the bank teller can't provide this information, you'll have to seek someone else within the bank who can.

      "Reference Response:  I recommend pulling up a retirement calculator and having an honest conversation about how long term savings works, and the power of compound interest. Just by playing around with the sliders on an online calculator, you can demonstrate how the early years are the most important. Depending on how much they make now and are considering saving, delaying 5-10 years can easily leave 6-7 figures on the table. If it's specifically a child or close family member, I recommend pulling up your retirement account. Talk with them about how you managed it, and how much you were putting in. Perhaps show them how much is the principal and how much is interest. If you did well, tell them how. If you didn't do as well as you liked, tell them what you would have done differently. Finally, discuss a bit of psychology. Even if they don't have a professional job and are making minimum wage, getting into the habit of saving makes it easier when they eventually make more. A couple of dollars a month isn't much, but getting into the habit makes it easier to save a couple hundred dollars a month later on.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I suggest utilizing a retirement savings calculator and candidly discussing how long-term financial saving operates, including the immense benefits of compounded interest. By exploring different variables on an online calculator, it can highlight especially how crucial the initial years are. Based on their current earnings and potential savings, procrastinating for 5-10 years could potentially lose them a significant amount, to the tune of 6-7 figures. If you are discussing with a child or a close relative, it would be beneficial to use your own retirement savings as an example. Share with them your strategy and the amount you contributed. You could also demonstrate the division between the principal amount and the interest accrued. Share anecdotes of your success and your missteps, and what you would have done differently if given a chance. Lastly, touch upon a bit about financial psychology. Even if they aren't professionally employed and only earning a minimal wage, the practice of regular saving now will form the habit, making it simpler when they eventually earn more. Saving even a small amount monthly can be a comfortable stepping stone towards stashing away a sizeable chunk every month in the future.\n",

The new student loans with the higher interest rates have changed the balance enough that it's no longer automatically better to keep it going as long as possible.

A few points to set against that, that you might want to consider: Not paying it off is a good hedge against your career not going as well as you expect, e.g. if the economy does badly, you have health problems, you take a career break for any reason. If that happens, you would end up not being forced to pay it off, so will end up gaining from not having done so voluntarily. The money you save in that case could be more valuable to you that the money you would lose if your career does go well. Not paying it off will increase your net cash earlier in life when you are more likely to need it, e.g. for a house deposit. Having more free cash could increase your options, making it possible to buy a house earlier in life. Or it could mean you have a higher deposit when you do buy, reducing the interest rate on the entire mortgage balance. The savings from that could end up being more than the 6% interest on the loan even though when you look at the loan in isolation it seems like a very bad rate.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  From an \"expected future value\" standpoint, it's clear that repaying this loan as speedily as you can, even to the extent of avoiding next year's lending, is a logical move. The high-interest rates of the latest student loans have altered the equation to the extent that prolonging the loan isn't automatically the best course of action any longer. An important factor in your situation, not applicable to everyone, is the likely inevitability of having to pay it off at some point anyhow. Thus, considering your life-long net costs, the most beneficial approach would be prompt repayment. However, there are certain factors you may want to think about: By not rushing into paying it off, you have a safety cushion for unforeseen circumstances such as a faltering career, economic downturns, health issues or taking a career break for any reason. Should these occur, you're not obliged to pay off the loan, thus providing a silver lining to not having done so prematurely. The funds saved in such an instance could prove more beneficial than those lost if your career takes off as expected. Not rushing the repayment could boost your immediate cash quantity at a period in life when it might be more urgently needed, say for a home down payment. Additional cash at hand could create more opportunities, such as buying a home earlier or making a larger down payment when you finally acquire one which could yield lesser mortgage rates. This could ultimately compensate for the seemingly severe 6% loan interest rate.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I don't believe there is any particular structural or financial reason that outgoing wire transfers cost so much in Canada, their costs are no higher than other countries (and lower than many).  Wires seem to be an area where the Canadian banks have decided people don't comparison shop, so it's not a competitive advantage to offer a better price. The rates you quoted are on the low side: $80 for a largish international wire is not unusual, and HSBC charges up to $150! There are several alternative ways to transfer money domestically in Canada. If the recipient banks at the same bank, it's possible to go into a branch and transfer money directly from your own account to their account (I've never been charged for this).  The transfer is immediate.  But it couldn't be done online, last time I checked. For transfers where you don't know the recipients bank account, you can pay online with Interac E-Transfers, offered by most Canadian banks.  It's basically e-mailing money.  It usually costs $1 to $1.50 per transfer, and has limits on how much you can send per day/week. Each of the banks also have a bill-pay service, but unlike similar services in the US (where they mail a paper check if the recipient isn't on their system), each Canadian bank has a limited number of possible payees (mostly utilities, governments, major stores).\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I am doubtful if there exists any specific structural or financial reason behind the high costs of outgoing wire transfers in Canada. Their charges are similar or even lesser than many other countries. It seems like Canadian banks have concluded that people won't compare prices for wire services, hence, offering a better price doesn't give them a competitive edge. The pricing you mentioned is rather modest: typically, an $80 charge for a sizable international wire isn't unwonted, and HSBC can even charge up to $150! Several other methods exist for domestic money transfers in Canada. When the person you're sending to banks at the same place, you can visit a branch and shift money directly from your account to theirs, and I've not incurred fees for this process. The transfer is instant. Nevertheless, I couldn't accomplish this online the last time I tried. If you're making transfers without knowing the recipient's bank account, you can opt for online payment through Interac E-Transfers, a service offered by most Canadian banks. Essentially, it's like sending money through an email, at a cost ranging from $1 to $1.50 per transfer, with restrictions imposed on the daily/weekly transfer amount. Every bank also provides a bill-pay service, but unlike the US where a paper check is mailed if the recipient is not on their system, each Canadian bank has a limited number of accepted payees, which mainly consist of utilities, governments, and mainstream stores.\n",

      "Reference Response:  My answer is specific to the US because you mentioned the Federal Reserve, but a similar system is in place in most countries. Do interest rates increase based on what the market is doing, or do they solely increase based on what the Federal Reserve sets them at? There are actually two rates in question here; the Wikipedia article on the federal funds rate has a nice description that I'll summarize here. The interest rate that's usually referred to is the federal funds rate, and it's the rate at which banks can lend money to each other through the Federal Reserve. The nominal federal funds rate - this is a target set by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve at each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). When you hear in the media that the Fed is changing interest rates, this is almost always what they're referring to. The actual federal funds rate - through the trading desk of the New York Federal Reserve, the FOMC conducts open market operations to enforce the federal funds rate, thus leading to the actual rate, which is the rate determined by market forces as a result of the Fed's operations. Open market operations involve buying and selling short-term securities in order to influence the rate. As an example, the current nominal federal funds rate is 0% (in economic parlance, this is known as the Zero Lower Bound (ZLB)), while the actual rate is approximately 25 basis points, or 0.25%. Why is it assumed that interest rates are going to increase when the Federal Reserve ends QE3? I don't understand why interest rates are going to increase. In the United States, quantitative easing is actually a little different from the usual open market operations the Fed conducts. Open market operations usually involve the buying and selling of short-term Treasury securities; in QE, however (especially the latest and ongoing round, QE3), the Fed has been purchasing longer-term Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). By purchasing MBS, the Fed is trying to reduce the overall risk of the commercial housing debt market. Furthermore, the demand created by these purchases drives up prices on the debt, which drives down interest rates in the commercial housing market. To clarify: the debt market I'm referring to is the market for mortgage-backed securities and other debt derivatives (CDO's, for instance). I'll use MBS as an example. The actual mortgages are sold to companies that securitize them by pooling them and issuing securities based on the value of the pool. This process may happen numerous times, since derivatives can be created based on the value of the MBS themselves, which in turn are based on housing debt. In other words, MBS aren't exactly the same thing as housing debt, but they're based on housing debt. It's these packaged securities the Fed is purchasing, not the mortgages themselves.  Once the Fed draws down QE3, however, this demand will probably decrease. As the Fed unloads its balance sheet over several years, and demand decreases throughout the market, prices will fall and interest rates in the commercial housing market will fall. Ideally, the Fed will wait until the economy is healthy enough to absorb the unloading of these securities.  Just to be clear, the interest rates that QE3 are targeting are different from the interest rates you usually hear about. It's possible for the Fed to unwind QE3, while still keeping the \"interest rate\", i.e. the federal funds rate, near zero. although this is considered unlikely. Also, the Fed can target long-term vs. short-term interest rates as well, which is once again slightly different from what I talked about above. This was the goal of the Operation Twist program in 2011 (and in the 1960's). Kirill Fuchs gave a great description of the program in this answer, but basically, the Fed purchased long-term securities and sold short-term securities, with the goal of twisting the yield curve to lower long-term interest rates relative to short-term rates. The goal is to encourage people and businesses to take on long-term debt, e.g. mortgages, capital investments, etc. My main question that I'm trying to understand is why interest rates are what they are. Is it more of an arbitrary number set by central banks or is it due to market activity? Hopefully I addressed much of this above, but I'll give a quick summary. There are many \"interest rates\" in numerous different financial markets. The rate most commonly talked about is the nominal federal funds rate that I mentioned above; although it's a target set by the Board of Governors, it's not arbitrary. There's a reason the Federal Reserve hires hundreds of research economists. No central bank arbitrarily sets the interest rate; it's determined as part of an effort to reach certain economic benchmarks for the foreseeable future, whatever those may be.  In the US, current Fed policy maintains that the federal funds rate should be approximately zero until the economy surpasses the unemployment and inflation benchmarks set forth by the Evans Rule (named after Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, who pushed for the rule). The effective federal funds rate, as well as other rates the Fed has targeted like interest rates on commercial housing debt, long-term rates on Treasury securities, etc. are market driven. The Fed may enter the market, but the same forces of supply and demand are still at work. Although the Fed's actions are controversial, the effects of their actions are still bound by market forces, so the policies and their effects are anything but arbitrary.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The explanation provided pertains specifically to the US context as it references the Federal Reserve, but analogous systems are functioning in most other nations. Wondering whether interest rates rise based on market trends or exclusively per the Federal Reserve's directives? There are two distinct rates to consider here; a comprehensive explanation can be found in the Wikipedia article related to the federal fund rates, which I'll briefly take you through. Usually, when we talk about interest rates, we refer to the federal funds rate - the rate at which banks lend money to each other via the Federal Reserve. The nominal federal funds rate is a target established by the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors at each Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) gathering. When the media announces changes in interest rates by the Fed, this is predominantly what they refer to. The real federal funds rate is enforced through open market operations by the FOMC via the New York's Federal Reserve's trading desk, resulting in an actual rate determined by market forces in response to the operations of the Fed. Open market operations comprise the buying and selling of short-term securities to effect the rate. For instance, the current nominal federal fund rate stands at 0% (described as the Zero Lower Bound (ZLB) in economic terms), while the actual rate is around 25 basis points or 0.25%. Why do people anticipate a rise in interest rates when the Federal Reserve concludes QE3? What makes interest rates rise? Quantitative easing in the US operates slightly distinctively from the Fed's regular open market operations. General open market operations typically involve trading short-term Treasury securities; however, in QE, the Fed has been buying long-term Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), particularly evident in the latest round, QE3. The Fed aims to minimize the overall commercial housing debt market risk by acquiring MBS. Besides, the demand surge resulting from these purchases boosts the debt prices, thereby reducing interest rates in the commercial housing market. The Fed purchases these bundled securities, and not the actual mortgages. When QE3 is eventually scaled down by the Fed, it's likely that this demand will taper off, potentially causing commercial property market interest rates to fall as the Fed unloads its securities over numerous years, and market-wide demand decreases. Under ideal circumstances, the Federal Reserve will delay until the economy is robust enough to handle the offloading of these securities. It is important to remind that the interest rates targeted by QE3 are distinct from the typical rates discussed. Unwinding QE3 could be feasible for the Fed while keeping the federal funds rate, i.e., the \"interest rate\", near zero, although it seldom happens. The Fed might aim for long-term versus short-term rates—an approach different, yet somewhat related to what I described above. The Operation Twist program of 2011 (and in the 1960s) aimed at this, where long-term securities were bought, short-term securities sold, to twist the yield curve to lower long-term interest rates compared to short-term rates, encouraging people and enterprises to take on long-term debt such as mortgages, capital investments, and so forth. One might question why interest rates are set at certain numbers. Is it a random figure determined by the central bank, or is it governed by market trends? I've attempted to address this through the text above, but here's a concise summation. There are various \"interest rates\" across an array of different financial markets. The most frequently discussed rate is the nominal federal funds rate stated above; it isn't random, although it is a target set by the Board of Governors. Hundreds of research economists are employed by the Federal Reserve for a reason. Central banks don't randomly establish the interest rate; it's a calculated move to meet specific economic indicators in the foreseeable future. Currently, the US Fed policy insists that the federal funds rate remain around zero until the economy exceeds the joblessness and inflation standards set by the Evans Rule (credited to Charles Evans, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago who proposed this rule). Rates like the effective federal funds rate and others targeted by the Fed, such as interest rates on commercial housing debt and long-term Treasury security rates, are market-dependent. Despite the controversial nature of the Fed's actions, their impacts remain governed by market forces, making both the policies and their results far from arbitrary.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The Dividend Discount Model is based on the concept that the present value of a stock is the sum of all future dividends, discounted back to the present. Since you said: dividends are expected to grow at a constant rate in perpetuity ... the Gordon Growth Model is a simple variant of the DDM, tailored for a firm in \"steady state\" mode, with dividends growing at a rate that can be sustained forever. Consider McCormick (MKC), who's last dividend was 31 cents, or $1.24 annualized. The dividend has been growing just a little over 7% annually. Let's use a discount, or hurdle rate of 10%. MKC closed today at $50.32, for what it's worth. The model is extremely sensitive to inputs. As g approaches r, the stock price rises to infinity. If g > r, stock goes negative. Be conservative with 'g' -- it must be sustainable forever.  The next step up in complexity is the two-stage DDM, where the company is expected to grow at a higher, unsustainable rate in the early years (stage 1), and then settling down to the terminal rate for stage 2. Stage 1 is the present value of dividends during the high growth period. Stage 2 is the Gordon Model, starting at the end of stage 1, and discounting back to the present. Consider Abbott Labs (ABT). The current annual dividend is $1.92, the current dividend growth rate is 12%, and let's say that continues for ten years (n), after which point the growth rate is 5% in perpetuity. Again, the discount rate is 10%. Stage 1 is calculated as follows: Stage 2 is GGM, using not today's dividend, but the 11th year's dividend, since stage 1 covered the first ten years. 'gn' is the terminal growth, 5% in our case. then... The value of the stock today is 21.22 + 51.50 = 72.72 ABT closed today at $56.72, for what it's worth.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The Dividend Discount Model (DDM) operates under the assumption that the current worth of a stock equates to the sum total of all prospective dividends, drawn back to their present-day value. You previously mentioned that dividends are anticipated to increase at a steady perpetual rate, thus, the Gordon Growth Model is an uncomplicated variation of the DDM, specifically designed for a company operating in a steady state, where the growth of dividends is sustainable indefinitely. For illustration, take McCormick (MKC). Their most recent dividend was 31 cents, which annualizes to $1.24. The dividend has experienced a slight growth of over 7% annually. We'll apply a discount or hurdle rate of 10%. Today, MKC's closing price was $50.32, as a point of reference. It's crucial to note that the model is highly sensitive to inputs. As 'g' nears 'r', the stock's prices surge indefinitely. If 'g' surpasses 'r', the stock value becomes negative. Thus, it's essential to adopt a conservative approach with 'g' as it needs to be viable eternally. The subsequent model, slightly more intricate, is the two-stage DDM. It's characterized by initial years of high, unsustainable growth (stage 1), followed by tapering off to a stable terminal rate in stage 2. The current value of dividends throughout the initial burst of growth determines stage 1, while stage 2 is determined by the Gordon Model, commencing at the conclusion of stage 1 and discounted back to the present. Consider Abbott Labs (ABT) as an example. Their current annual dividend is $1.92, with a present growth rate of 12%, projected to continue for a decade (n), after which the growth rate gradually reduces to 5% indefinitely. Again, the discount rate applied is 10%. The formula to calculate stage 1 is as follows: Stage 2 employs the GGM, making use of the 11th year's dividend, as stage 1 accounted for the initial ten-year segment. A terminal growth rate of 5% is set as 'gn'. By these calculations, the stock's current value is 21.22 + 51.50, equaling 72.72. By comparison, ABT's closing price today was $56.72.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Disclaimer: I work in life insurance, but I am not an agent.   First things first, there is not enough information here to give you an answer.  When discussing life insurance, the very first things we need to fully consider are the illustration of policy values, and the contract itself.  Without these, there is no way to tell if this is a good idea or not. So what are the things to look for? A. Risk appetite.  People love to discuss projections of the market, like for example, \"7-8% a year compounded annually\".  Go look at the historical returns of the stock market.  It is never close to that projection.  Life insurance, however, can give you a GUARANTEED return (this would be show in the 'Guaranteed' section of the life insurance illustration).  As long as you pay your premiums, this money is guaranteed to accrue.  Now most life insurance companies also show 'Non-Guaranteed' elements in their illustrations - these are non-guaranteed projections based on a scale at this point in time.  These columns will show how your cash value may grow when dividends are credited to your policy (and used to buy paid-up additional insurance, which generates more dividends - this can be compared to the compounding nature of interest).   B. Tax treatment.  I am definitely not an expert in this area, but life insurance does have preferential tax treatment, particularly to your beneficiaries. C. Beneficiaries.  Any death benefit (again, listed as guaranteed and maybe non-guaranteed values) is generally completely tax free for the beneficiary. D. Strategy.  Tying all of this together, what exactly is the point of this?  To transfer wealth, to accrue wealth, or some combination thereof?  This is important and unstated in your question. So again, without knowing more, there is no way to answer your question.  But I am surprised that in this forum, so many people are quick to jump in and say in general that whole life insurance is a scam.  And even more surprising is the fact the accepted answer has already been accepted. My personal take is that if you are just trying to accrue wealth, you should probably stick to the market and maybe buy term if you want a death benefit component.  This is mostly due to your age (higher risk of death = higher premiums = lower buildup) and how long of a time period you have to build up money in the policy.  But if a 25 year old asked this same question, depending on his purposes, I may suggest that a WL policy is in fact a good idea.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Please note that I work within the life insurance industry but I'm not a licensed agent. Primarily, it should be stated that the details provided here are insufficient to reach a conclusion. In any discussion about life insurance, we must first thoroughly review the policy value illustrations and the actual agreement. Without these two components, it's not feasible to determine whether this is a wise decision. So what are the crucial factors to consider?\n",
      "\n",
      "A. Risk Tolerance: A popular discussion topic is future market forecasts, such as '7-8% annual compound growth.' The historical performance of the stock market, however, rarely matches such forecasts. Life insurance, on the other hand, assures a certain return, as documented in the 'Guaranteed' section of the insurance illustration. As long as premium payments are made, this return is guaranteed. While most insurance companies present 'Non-Guaranteed' aspects in their illustrations, these represent non-guaranteed predictions based on the current timescale. This section shows the potential growth of your cash value when dividends are added to your policy and used to purchase additional paid-up insurance, which then produces more dividends. This process parallels the compound growth of interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "B. Tax Considerations: Although I'm no expert on taxes, life insurance generally offers favorable tax treatment, particularly for beneficiaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "C. Beneficiaries: Any death benefit is typically entirely tax-free for the recipient, whether it is listed as guaranteed or possibly non-guaranteed.\n",
      "\n",
      "D. Strategy: In tying all of these aspects together, you should consider the purpose behind owning a life insurance policy. Are you intending to transfer accumulated wealth, build it, or a combination of both? The intention was not specified in your question, which is vital information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, without more specific details, it's impossible to provide a comprehensive answer. I find it surprising that in discussions like these, numerous individuals deem whole life insurance as fraudulent, and even more, peg the answer that supports this view as the accepted response. \n",
      "\n",
      "From my perspective, if you are primarily focused on wealth accumulation, your best bet would be to stick to the marketplace and possibly purchase term insurance if you desire a death benefit component. This depends mostly on your age, since a higher likelihood of death equates to higher premiums and lesser buildup, and the time frame you have to accumulate a substantial amount in the policy. However, if a 25-year-old were to ask this question, depending on their goal, I might advise that a whole life policy could indeed be a suitable choice.\n",

It was still reasonably new, very reliable, and with California weather, you can use it year-round. It reduced my time in traffic, and it had very low fuel and maintenance costs. The biggest expense was tires. The biggest pitfall in buying a motorcycle is auto-insurance. Do your research and ask for quotes from your broker before even considering a particular model of bike. When I decided that my finances justified a new motorcycle, I was surprised that full collision coverage cost about $3000/year on a lower powered bike that had a bad accident record because it appealed to new riders. I got a much more powerful bike that appealed to more experienced riders and the premium was only $500/year. Is this answer not what you were looking for?

To my surprise, when I resolved that my financial situation could support a new motorcycle, the full accident coverage priced around $3000/year on a less powerful bike that had a poor incident history as it attracted inexperienced riders. I opted for a more powerful bike that was popular with seasoned riders and the premium cost was only $500 per year. Not the answer you were hoping for? Try to spend the minimum possible on a car that is 4-6 years old. Drive it until you've saved up enough to afford the car you genuinely desire. I am currently behind the wheel of a 2007 Corolla and patiently awaiting the time when I can afford a new Civic Turbo with a manual transmission as a replacement. (At the moment, they only provide them with a CVT, but by next fall, they will have manual transmission versions so it will probably be another 2 1/2 years before I can buy one second-hand.)\n",

      "Reference Response:  This sort of involves personal finance, and sort of not. But it's an interesting question, so let's call it on topic? Short answer: yes. Long answer: it depends who's asking. If you're trying to qualify for in-state tuition, for example, you need to have been in state for a certain amount of time. For tax purposes, the first year you move to a new state you need to file part-time resident returns in your previous and current state of residency\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  This is somewhat related to personal finance, but not entirely. However, it's a compelling query, so shall we consider it relevant? In brief, the answer is yes. A more detailed response would be based on who is posing the question. If you are seeking to qualify for in-state tuition, for instance, there is a specific duration of residency requirement within the state. Moreover, for taxation, during your initial year of relocating, you must submit part-time residential tax returns in both your old and new states of residency.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The stock price is not only based on the general market trend and the stock's current profitability and prospects, but is also based on prediction of how the stock's prospects might change in the future. In almost every case, there are professional investors analysing the stock's future prospects and considering whether it's over or under values for its current price. However even professionals can be totally wrong.  If you feel like you have a good grasp on whether the stock will have improving or declining prospects over time, then you might be (if you're right) equipped to make a sensible decision on whether to hold the stock or not. If you don't think you have a good understanding about the stock, then an understanding of the general market direction might at least make stock in general worth holding. Otherwise, you are simply taking a punt. If you know of another stock that has better prospects, then ask yourself why you would hold onto the stock that you think will perform worse.  But also bear in mind that (in my understanding) research has shown that, on average, people who try to pick stocks rarely do better than a random selection, and more stock trades means more brokerage (which thanks to brokerage losses would mean you will end up doing worse than average unless you really do know better than the market).\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The valuation of a stock is influenced not only by the overall market trend and its current profitability and future potential, but it is also tied to predictions about potential transformations in the stock's future. Typically, there are seasoned investors scrutinizing these future predictions and determining if the stock's present worth is over or undervalued. Nevertheless, even these specialists can make serious blunders. If you believe you have a reliable understanding of the stock's potential upward or downward trajectory, you may be in a position to make a smart choice about retaining or abandoning the stock, granted you're accurate in your assessment. If you are uncertain about your understanding of the stock, then having some knowledge of the overall market trend could make holding stocks in general worthwhile. Otherwise, you're merely gambling. If you are aware of an alternative stock with superior potential, consider why you would retain a stock that you predict to perform poorly. However, also remember that (to my knowledge) studies have demonstrated that individuals attempting to choose stocks seldom outperform random selections. Additionally, more stock trades result in greater brokerage fees, potentially leading to net losses unless you actually have superior knowledge than the broader market.\n",

In months where he gets more than this, the excess should be put aside. In really bad months where the income drops below the expected minimum, he can use the money put aside. After a year of putting money aside, he can plan to use and budget this for any other expenses.\n",

      "Reference Response:  A minor tangent. One can claim the S&P has a mean return of say 10%, and standard deviation of say 14% or so, but when you run with that, you find that the actual returns aren't such a great fit to the standard bell curve. Market anomalies producing the \"100-year flood\" far more often than predicted over even a 20 year period. This just means that the model doesn't reflect reality at the tails, even if the +/- 2 standard deviations look pretty. This goes for the Black-Sholes (I almost abbreviated it to initials, then thought better, I actually like the model) as well. The distinction between American and European is small enough that the precision of the model is wider than the difference of these two option styles. I believe if you look at the model and actual pricing, you can determine the volatility of a given stock by using prices around the strike price, but when you then model the well out of money options, you often find the market creating its own valuation.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  A brief diversion. You could argue that the S&P has an average return of around 10%, with a standard deviation of approximately 14%, but when you delve into it, you'll find that the actual returns don't align as well with the traditional bell curve as you might think. Market anomalies frequently generate the so-called \"100-year flood\" more often than anticipated over even two decades. This simply implies that the model does not accurately depict reality at the extreme ends, even if the +/- 2 standard deviations appear alluring. This applies to the Black-Sholes model too (I was close to using its acronym, but I appreciate the model and decided against it). The difference between American and European is so negligible that the model's precision exceeds the disparity between these two option styles. I posit that if you scrutinize the model and actual pricing, you can discern a stock's volatility using prices around the strike point, but when you then model the far out of money options, the market often contrives its own evaluation.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Fund rebalancing typically refers to changing the investment mix to stay within the guidelines of the mutual fund objective.  For example, lets say a fund is supposed to have at least 20% in bonds.  Because of a dramatic increase in stock price and decrease in bond values it finds itself with only 19.9% in bonds at the end of the trading day.  The fund manager would sell sufficient equities to reduce its equity holdings and buy more bonds.   Rebalancing is not always preferential because it could cause capital gain distribution, typically once per year, without selling the fund.  And really any trading within the fun could do the same. In the case you cite the verbiage is confusing.  Often times I wonder if the author knows less then the reader.  It might also be a bit of a rush to get the article out, and the author did not write correctly. I agree that the ETFs cited are suitable for short term traders.  However, that is because, traditionaly, the market has increased in value over the long term.  If you bet it will go down over the long term, you are almost certain to lose money. Like you, I cannot figure out how rebalancing makes this suitable only for short term traders.  If the ETFs distribute capital gains events much more frequently then once per year, that is worth mentioning, but does not provide a case for short versus long term traders.   Secondly, I don't think these funds are doing true rebalancing.  They might change investments daily for the most likely profitable outcome, but that really isn't rebalancing.   It seems the author is confused.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Essentially, fund rebalancing relates to adjusting the allocation of investments to maintain alignment with the overall goal of the mutual fund. To illustrate, suppose a fund is required to hold a minimum of 20% in bonds. A significant surge in stock prices and a drop in bond values leave the fund with merely 19.9% in bonds by close of business. The fund manager would then need to offload enough stocks to slash its equity stake and purchase additional bonds. Rebalancing isn't always advantageous since it might lead to an annual distribution of capital gains, even without the need to sell the fund. Indeed, any intra-fund trading could trigger a similar outcome. The wording you're referencing is a bit unclear. Sometimes it seems the writer might be less knowledgeable than the reader. It may also be an outcome of rushing the publication, resulting in less than perfect writing. I concur that the mentioned ETFs are ideal for traders with a short-term outlook. But this is mostly because, over the long haul, markets have generally trended upwards. Anyone predicting long-term market downfall is likely to incur losses. Like you, I'm puzzled about how rebalancing renders these funds solely suitable for short-term traders. If the ETFs yield capital gains occurrences more than once a year, it's worth mentioning, yet it doesn’t necessarily argue for short versus long-term trading. Second, I'm skeptical whether these funds are engaging in genuine rebalancing. They might alter investments on a daily basis to maximize potential profits, but that can't be classified as rebalancing. The writer appears to be mistaken in their understanding.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Depends. If you can choose where to relocate to, then I second the \"no income tax\" states. But even of these chose wisely, some have no income taxes at all, others have taxes on some kinds of income. Some don't have neither individual nor corporate taxes, some tax businesses in some ways. Some compensate with higher property taxes, others compensate with higher sales taxes. On the other hand, you might prefer states with income taxes but no sales taxes. It can happen if your current income is going to be low, but you'll be spending your savings. If you don't have a choice (for example, your employer wants you to move closer to their office), then you're more limited. Still, you can use the tax break on moving expenses (read the fine print, there are certain employment requirements), and play with the state taxes (if you're moving to a state with less/no taxes - move earlier, if its the other way - move later). Check out for cities that have income taxes. In some states it cannot happen by law (for example, in California only the state is allowed to collect income taxes), in others it is very common (Ohio comes to mind). Many things to consider in New York. New York City has its own income tax (as well as Yonkers, as far as I remember these are the only ones in the State of New York). So if you want to save on taxes in NYS but live close to the city, consider White Plains etc. If you work in NYC its moot, you're going to pay city taxes anyway. That is also true if you live in NJ but work in the city, so tax-wise it may be more efficient not to live across state lines from your place of work.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The answer can vary. If you have the option to choose your relocation destination, I would similarly recommend considering states without income tax. However, it would be prudent to choose wisely among these, as some do not levy income tax at all, while others impose taxes on certain types of income. Some states do not charge either individuals or corporations, whereas some tax businesses in specific ways. Some balance this with elevated property taxes, while others opt for higher sales taxes instead. Conversely, you might find states that impose income tax but not sales tax more appealing. This scenario is possible if you're anticipating a smaller income but plan to exhaust your savings. If your relocation options are limited, for instance; your employer requires you to live closer to work, your choices are significantly reduced. You could, however, potentially benefit from the tax deduction on relocation expenses (putting employment prerequisites into consideration), and manipulate your state taxes (propose to move earlier if destined for a state with lesser or no taxes and contrarily, plan a later move if taxes are higher). Look out for cities that impose income taxes. By law, some states don't permit this; for example, only California can enforce income tax collection, however, in some places, it's relatively common, like in Ohio. Numerous factors need to be assessed in New York. Notably, New York City levies its proprietor tax (Yonkers too, to my recollection these are the exceptions within New York State). So, if you desire tax savings in NYS but want proximity to the city, you might want to look into White Plains, among others. If you're employed in NYC, this is pointless as you'll pay the city tax regardless. This also holds for individuals residing in NJ but working in the city, hence residing within the same state as your workplace might be more tax-efficient.\n",

      "Reference Response: Reference Response:  If your requirements are hard (must have $1000/month, must have the same or bigger in capital at the end), stocks are a poor choice of investment. However, in many cases, people are willing to tolerate some level of risk to achieve the expected returns. You also do not mention inflation, which can take quite a lot out of your portfolio over the course of ten years. If we make some simplifying assumptions, you want to generate $12,000 a year. You can realistically expect the (whole) stock market, long term (i.e. over time periods substantially longer than 10 years), to return approximately 4 - 5% after factoring in inflation. That means an investment of $240,000 - $300,000 (the math is simplified somewhat here). If you don't care about inflation, you can up the percentage rather somewhat. According to this article, the S&P 500 returned an average of 11.31% from 1928 through 2010 (not factoring in inflation), which would require an investment of approximately $106,100. But! This opens you up to substantial risk. The stock market may go down 30% this year! According to the above article, the S&P returned only 3.54% from 2001 to 2010. Long-term, it goes up, but your investment case is really unsuited to investing in an index to the entire stock market given your requirements. You may be better suited investing primarily in stable bonds, or perhaps a mix of bonds and stocks. Alternatively, you may want to consider even more stable investments such as treasury notes. Treasury notes are all but guaranteed, but with a lousy rate of return. Heck, you could consider a GIC (that may be Canada-only) or even a savings account. There's also the possibility of purchasing an annuity, though almost everyone will advise against such. Personally, I'd go for a mutual fund which invested approximately 70% bonds and the rest in stocks over such a time period. Something like ING Direct's Streetwise Balanced Income Portfolio, if you were in Canada. It substantially lowers your expected return but also lowers your risk. I can't honestly say what the expected return there is; at this point, it's returned 4% per year (before inflation), but has been around only since the beginning of 2008. And to be clear, this is absolutely not free of risk.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  If through your investment, you must make $1000 a month and maintain or grow your initial capital, then investing in stocks may not be for you. Many people, though, are open to taking on a certain degree of risk for the potential returns. One point that goes unmentioned is inflation, which can significantly affect your portfolio over a decade. With some simplification, if your goal is to earn $12,000 per annum, you can hope for a return of 4 - 5% from the entire stock market in the long run (significantly longer than ten years), once inflation is considered, meaning you would need to invest between $240,000 to $300,000. If inflation isn't a concern for you, you can increase your percentage a bit more. An article I read mentioned that the S&P 500 averaged an 11.31% return from 1928 to 2010 (without accounting for inflation), which demands a projected investment of roughly $106,100. However, this approach exposes you to significant risk. The stock market can drop by 30% in a year! The article also says that the S&P only yielded a 3.54% return from 2001 to 2010. In the long run, it increases, but your particular investment needs might not be ideal for investing in a comprehensive stock market index. It could suit you better to invest mainly in reliable bonds or perhaps a blend of bonds and stocks. Alternatively, even safer investment options to consider could include treasury notes that are virtually guaranteed, but offer minimal returns. Other options might be a GIC (which may be exclusive to Canada), or simply a savings account. You could even consider buying an annuity, although most experts would advise against it. My personal preference would be a mutual fund that invests roughly 70% in bonds and the rest in stocks for that time frame. An example is ING Direct's Streetwise Balanced Income Portfolio, if you're based in Canada. This dramatically reduces your potential return, but it also minimizes your risk. The exact return is unclear; so far it's yielded a 4% annual return (pre-inflation), but it's only been around since the start of 2008. Remember, no investment is completely risk-free.\n",

See https://www.irs.gov/individuals/self-employed for some basics and lots of useful links. If this income is large enough your tax on it will be more than $1000, you may need to make quarterly estimated payments (OR if you also have a 'day job' have that employer increase your withholding) to avoid an underpayment penalty. But if this is the first year you have significant self-employment income (or other taxable but unwithheld income like realized capital gains) and your economic/tax situation is otherwise unchanged -- i.e. you have the same (or more) payroll income with the same (or more) withholding -- then there is a 'safe harbor': if your withholding plus estimated payments this year is too low to pay this year's tax but it is enough to pay last year's tax you escape the penalty.

This should be done regardless of whether or not the payee has to provide you with a 1099-MISC or a 1099-K for a payment network currently.

      " I compared investing in real estate a few years ago to investing in stocks that paid double digit dividends (hard to find, however, managing and maintaining real estate is just as hard).  After discussing with many in the real estate world, I counted the average and learned that most averaged about 6 - 8% on real estate after taxes.  This does not include anything else like Dilip mentions (maintenance, insurance, etc).  For those who want to avoid that route, you can buy some companies that invest in real estate or REIT funds like Dilip mentions.  However, they are also susceptible to the problems mentioned above this. In terms of other investment opportunities like stocks or funds, think about businesses that will always be around and will always be needed.  We won't outgrow our need for real estate, but we won't outgrow our need for food or tangible goods either.  You can diversify into these companies along with real estate or buy a general mutual fund. Finally, one of your best investments is your career field - software.  Do some extra work on the side and see if you can get an adviser position at a start-up (it's actually not that hard and it will help you build your skill set) or create a site which generates passive revenue (again, not that hard).  One software engineer told me a few years ago that the stock market is a relic of the past and the new passive income would be generated by businesses that had tools which did all the work through automation (think of a smart phone application that you build once, yet continues to generate revenue).  This was right before the crash, and after it, everyone talked about another \"lost decade.\"  While it does require extra work initially, like all things software related, you'll be discovering tools in programming that you can use again and again in other applications - meaning your first one may be the most difficult. All it takes in this case is one really good idea ...\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  A few years back, I examined the similarities between investments in real estate and high-yielding stocks - both are challenging to come by and manage, similar to handling properties. After engaging with numerous individuals from the property sphere, I found that the average return was about 6 - 8% post-tax. This total doesn't include details like upkeep costs or insurance that Dilip also brings up. If you're looking to sidestep this path, consider purchasing shares in real estate companies or opting for REIT funds, like Dilip suggests. Yet, they're not immune to the struggles outlined earlier. For alternative investments like stocks or funds, consider companies offering vital services or products that will always persist. Real estate, food, and physical goods are all irreplaceable. You can opt to diversify your portfolio with these sectors and real estate, or go for a standard mutual fund. Whatever you choose, remember that one of the best investment opportunities lies in your professional field - software development. You might consider taking additional projects, aiming to secure an advisory role in a start-up (it's not as challenging as it sounds), or establishing a site that can yield a passive income for you. A software developer I knew once shared that stocks are becoming a thing of the past and the new wave of passive income would be driven by businesses having tools leveraging automation to do all the work. He said this before the economic collapse, but post-crash it seems everyone was discussing another \"lost decade.\" However, there's an upside, while the initial extra work is required,  software-related tasks may unveil numerous programming tools, each making future projects that much easier.

      "Reference Response:  At twenty-two, you can have anywhere between 100%-70% of your securities portfolio in equities. It is reasonable to start at 100% and reduce over time.  The one thing that I would mention with that is that your target at retirement should be 70% stocks/30% bonds.  You should NEVER have more than 30% bonds.  Why?  Because a 70/30 mix is both safer than 100% bonds and will give a higher return.  Absent some market timing strategy (which as an amateur investor, you should absolutely avoid) or some complicated balancing scheme, there is never a reason to be at more than 30% bonds.   A 50/50 mix of stocks and bonds or a 100% bonds ratio not only returns less than the 70/30 mix, it is actually riskier.  Why?  Because sometimes bonds fall.  And when they do, stocks generally gain.  And vice versa.  Because of this behavior, the 70/30 mix is less likely to fall than 50% or 100% bonds.   Does that mean that your stock percentage should never drop below 70%?  No.  If your portfolio contains things other than stocks and bonds, it is reasonable for stocks to fall below 70%.  The problem is that when you drop stocks below 70%, you should drop bonds below 30% as well.  So you keep the stock to bond ratio at 7:3.   If you want to get a lower risk than a 70/30 mix, then you should move into cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents are actually safer than stocks and bonds either individually or in combination.  But at twenty-two, you don't really need more safety.   At twenty-two, the first thing to do is to build your emergency fund.  This should be able to handle six months of expenses without income.  I recommend making it equal to six months of your income.  The reason being that it is easy to calculate your income and difficult to be sure of expenses.  Also, you can save six months of income at twenty-two.   Are you going to stay where you are for the next five years?  At twenty-two, the answer is almost certainly no.  But the standard is the five year time frame.  If you want a bigger place or one that is closer to work, then no.  If you stay somewhere at least five years, then it is likely that the advantages to owning rather than renting will outweigh the costs of switching houses.  Less than five years, the reverse is true.  So you should probably rent now.   You can max out your 401k and IRA now.  Doing so even with a conservative strategy will produce big returns by sixty-seven.  And perhaps more importantly, it helps keep your spending down.  The less you do spend, the less you will feel that you need to spend.   Once you fill your emergency fund, start building savings for a house.  I would consider putting them in a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).  A REIT will tend to track real estate.  Since you want to buy real estate with the results, this is its own kind of safety.  It fell in value?  Houses are probably cheap.  Houses increasing in price rapidly?  A REIT is probably growing by leaps and bounds.  You do this outside your retirement accounts, as you want to be able to access it without penalty.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  At the age of 22, your securities portfolio could comprise of 70% to 100% equities. Commencing with 100% and gradually decreasing is sensible. However, it's worth pointing out that upon retirement, your objective should be a 70/30 split between stocks and bonds. Under no circumstance should your bond allocation exceed 30%. The reason being, a 70/30 proportion is safer and yields greater returns than a 100% investment in bonds. Unless you're adept at sophisticated methods like market timing strategies or complex balancing schemes, it's not advisable to exceed 30% bond investment. A 50/50 allocation or full investment in bonds not only generates less returns than the 70/30 split, it's also riskier considering the possible depreciations of bonds and vice versa for stocks. This behaviour renders a 70/30 allocation less prone to a major downfall in comparison to 50% or 100% bond investments. But should your stock allocation always stay above 70%? The answer is no, especially when your portfolio incorporates investments other than stocks and bonds, thereby justifying a stock allocation below 70%, with a correspondent drop in bonds to maintain the 7:3 ratio. For reduced risk, you might consider cash equivalents which pose less risk than individual or combined stocks and bonds. Yet, as a 22-year-old, you can cope with greater risk. At this stage, your initial commitment should be to establish an emergency fund that could sustain up to six months of expenses without income, and I suggest this amount to be equivalent to six months of your earnings. This is because it's simpler to measure your income than to calculate your expenses. Moreover, you can definitely save up an amount equal to six months of income at 22. Are you planning to stay in your current location for the next five years? Probably not, at 22. But, the typical duration is five years. If you're thinking of moving to a bigger house or to a more convenient location near work, it's better to hold off. If you're sure of staying put for at least five years, then home-ownership is more advantageous than renting. Otherwise, the scenario flips and renting proves to be a better choice. Given your age, you can max out your 401k and IRA contributions which, in addition to boosting your wealth by the age of sixty-seven, will also help in controlling your spending. The money saved will further reduce your perception of your spending needs. After your emergency fund is set, focus on gathering savings for buying a house. A feasible strategy would be to invest in a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) as its performance is likely to mirror real estate trends. This acts as a natural safeguard. If housing prices drop, so does the REIT value making houses affordable. If housing prices skyrocket, your REIT also flourishes. Ensure these investments are separate from your retirement account to eschew any penalties.\n",

Either way your son wasn't the one supposed to know all the internal rules. I don't think it matters if they cashed the check or not. I would tell them if they have cashed it, that is even more evidence the deal was finalized. But even if they they didn't cash it, it only proves they are very disorganized. If for some reason your son feels forced to redo the deal, have him start the negotiations way below the price that was agreed to.  If the deal for some strange reason gets voided don't let him agree to some sort of restocking fee.\n",

The fault lies either with their mistake or with their deception, but your son shouldn't have been expected to know all of their internal regulations. Whether they deposited the check or not seems irrelevant. If they did, that's even more affirmation that the agreement was set in stone. But even if they didn't deposit it, it just highlights their lack of organization. If somehow your son is pressured to renegotiate, he should start the bargaining significantly lower than the previously agreed-upon price.

Share price is meaningless.   Google is $700 per share, Apple is $100 per share, that doesn't say anything about either company and/or whether or not one is a better investment over the other. You should not evaluate an investment decision on price of a share.  Look at the books decide if the company is worth owning, then decide if it's worth owning at it's current price.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  My thoughts were centered on the idea that the worth of the stock is what essentially matters and not the quantity of shares, though I'm uncertain. You are indeed right. The pricing per share holds little significance. Take, for example, Google's shares are $700 each while Apple's are at $100; this doesn't provide any insight about the corporations or the superiority of investment in one over the other. A decision to invest should not hinge on the price per share. It would be wiser to scrutinize the financial statements, assess the value of the company, and only then determine if the current price tag is appropriate for ownership.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The short answer is the annualised volatility over twenty years should be pretty much the same as the annualised volatility over five years. For independent, identically distributed returns the volatility scales proportionally. So for any number of monthly returns T, setting the annualization factor m = 12 annualises the volatility.  It should be the same for all time scales.  However, note the discussion here: https://quant.stackexchange.com/a/7496/7178 Scaling volatility [like this] only is mathematically correct when the   underlying price model is driven by Geometric Brownian motion which   implies that prices are log normally distributed and returns are   normally distributed. Particularly the comment: \"its a well known fact that volatility is overestimated when scaled over long periods of time without a change of model to estimate such \"long-term\" volatility.\" Now, a demonstration.  I have modelled 12,000 monthly returns with mean = 3% and standard deviation = 2, so the annualised volatility should be Sqrt(12) * 2 = 6.9282.   Calculating annualised volatility for return sequences of various lengths (3, 6, 12, 60 months etc.) reveals an inaccuracy for shorter sequences.  The five-year sequence average got closest to the theoretically expected figure (6.9282), and, as the commenter noted \"volatility is [slightly] overestimated when scaled over long periods of time\". Annualised volatility for varying return sequence lengths  Edit re. comment Reinvesting returns does not affect the volatility much.  For instance, comparing some data I have handy, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Capital Returns (CR) versus Net Returns (NR).  The return differences are somewhat smoothed, 0.1% each month, 0.25% every third month.  More erratic dividend reinvestment would increase the volatility.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The yearly volatility for two decades should, in essence, align with the yearly volatility across five years. In the case of uniform, independently fluctuating returns, volatility expands proportionately. Thus, for any set of monthly returns T, applying an annualization factor m = 12 will yield annualized volatility. This should hold consistent across all timescales. However, keep this conversation in focus: https://quant.stackexchange.com/a/7496/7178. Scaling volatility in this manner is only accurate mathematically if the fluctuating price model is propelled by Geometric Brownian motion, suggesting that prices are log-normally allocated and returns follow the normal distribution. A noteworthy comment on the matter points out, \"it's a widely accepted truth that volatility is prone to over-estimation when scaled over extensive periods without adjusting the model to estimate such 'long-period' volatility.\" Here's an example: For 12,000 monthly returns with a 3% mean and 2 standard deviation, the annualized volatility should be the square root of 12 multiplied by 2 or, 6.9282. Annualized volatility calculated for different return sequence lengths (3, 6, 12, 60 months and so forth), shows a slight inaccuracy for shorter lengths. The five-year sequence average lands the closest to the theoretical expectation (6.9282), confirming that volatility is somewhat over-calculated when evaluated over more extended periods. In terms of varying return sequence lengths, annualized volatility is used. About the comment, reinvesting returns doesn't significantly impact volatility. An analysis of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Capital Returns (CR) compared to Net Returns (NR) supports this, with minor monthly differences and quarterly fluctuations, with more irregular dividend reinvestment possibly raising the volatility.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Small purchases will have a disproportionate expense for commissions. Even a $5 trade fee is 5% on a $100 purchase. So on one hand, it's common to advise individuals just starting out to use mutual funds, specifically index funds with low fees. On the flip side, holding stocks has no annual fee, and if you are buying for the long term, you may still be better off with an eye toward cost, and learn over time.  In theory, an individual stands a better chance to beat the experts for a number of reasons, no shareholders to answer to, and the ability to purchase without any disclosure, among them. In reality, most investor lag the average by such a wide margin, they'd be best off indexing and staying in for the long term.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Minor transactions often yield an unbalanced cost due to commissions; for instance, a $5 trade fee constitutes 5% on a $100 transaction. Hence, those new to investing are usually advised to opt for mutual funds, specifically index funds that carry low charges. Conversely, stock holdings come without an annual fee, and making a long-term commitment could yield benefits, especially when taking into account costs over time. Theoretically, an individual has the potential to outperform professionals for several reasons, including the absence of shareholder obligations and the privilege to buy without any disclosure.

      "Reference Response:  To sum up: My question came from misunderstanding what cost basis applies to. Now I get it that it applies to stocks as physical entities. Consider a chain of buys of 40 stock A with prices $1-$4-$10-$15 (qty 10 each time) then IRS wants to know exactly which stock I am selling. And when I transfer stocks to different account, that cost basis transfers with them. Cost basis is included in transfers, so that removes ambiguity which stock is being sold on the original account. In the example above, cost basis of 20 stocks moved to a new account would probably be $1 x 10 and $4 x 10, i.e. FIFO also applies to transfers.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In conclusion, my confusion was regarding the application of cost basis. Now, I understand that it refers to stocks in their tangible aspect. Take into account an order of 40 units of stock A with prices of $1, $4, $10, $15 (each time buying 10) - it's important for the IRS to know precisely which stock I'm disposing of. Moreover, when I shift stocks to a different account, the cost basis moves along with them. The concept of cost basis is incorporated in these transitions, which eliminates any confusion about which stock is being traded in the original account. Following the logic of the aforementioned example, the cost basis for 20 stocks transferred to a new account would likely be $10 for $1 stocks and $40 for $4 stocks, suggesting that the FIFO rule is also applicable in transfers.\n",

      "Reference Response:  It certainly is possible for a run on the bank to drive it into insolvency.  And yes, if the bank makes some bad loans, it can magnify the problem. Generally, this does not happen, though.  Remember that banks usually have lots of customers, and people are depositing money and making mortgage payments every day, so there is usually enough on-hand to cover average banking withdrawl activity, regardless of any bad loans they have outstanding. Banks have lots of historical data to know what the average withdrawl demands are for a given day.  They also have risk models to predict the likelihood of their loans going into default.  A bank will generally use this information to strike a healthy balance between profit-making activity (e.g. issuing loans), and satisfying its account holders. In the event of a major withdrawl demand, there are some protections in place to guard against insolvency. There are regulations that specify a Reserve Requirement.  The bank must keep a certain amount of money on hand, so they can't take huge risks by loaning out too much money all at once.  Regulators can tweak this requirement over time to reflect the current economic situation. If a bank does run into trouble, it can take out a short-term loan.  Either from another bank, or from the central bank (e.g. the US Federal Reserve).  Banks don't want to pay interest on loans any more than you do, so if they are regularly borrowing money, they will adjust thier cash reserves accordingly. If all else fails and the bank can't meet its obligations (e.g. the Fed loan fell through), the bank has an insurance policy to make sure the account holders get paid.  In the US, this is what the FDIC is for.  Worst case, the bank goes under, but your money is safe. These protections have worked pretty well for many decades.  However, during the recent financial crisis, all three of these protections were under heavy strain.  So, one of the things banking regulators did was to put the major banks through stress tests to make sure they could handle several bad financial events without collapsing.  These tests showed that some banks didn't have enough money in reserve.  (Not long after, banks started to increase fees and credit card rates to raise this additional capital.) Keep in mind that if banks were unable to use the deposited money (loan it out, invest it, etc), the current financial landscape would change considerably.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Indeed, a bank run could potentially lead to its insolvency. Plus, this issue might be exacerbated if the bank has been involved in poor lending decisions. Nevertheless, this is usually not the case. Keep in mind banks have numerous clients who continuously deposit funds and repay their mortgages, ensuring a steady cash flow to counter the common level of withdrawal demands— despite any outstanding bad loans. Banks pull from years of experience to gauge typical daily withdrawal rates and develop risk strategies to forecast potential loan defaults. A bank commonly uses this information to find a healthy equilibrium between profit-making activities (for instance, granting loans), and satisfying its patrons. If a large withdrawal request occurs, there are contingency measures in place to circumvent insolvency. Regulations stipulate a Reserve Requirement, demanding banks to reserve a certain amount of liquid assets, thus curtailing excessive lending risk. Regulators can modify this requirement to suit the prevailing economic climate. If a bank encounters financial problems, it can resort to a short-term loan, possibly from another bank, or from the central bank (like the US Federal Reserve). Banks wish to avoid loan interest as much as individuals do; therefore, if they are frequently borrowing, they will accordingly adjust their cash reserves. If all safeguards fail and the bank isn't able to fulfill its obligations (in the event, for example, that the Fed loan doesn't go through), there's an insurance policy in place to assure account holders are compensated. In the US, this function is served by the FDIC. In the worst-case scenario, the bank might collapse, but your finances remain secure. These safeguards have largely been effective over a span of many years. However, during the recent economic downturn, these protections were put to the test. As a result, banking regulators initiated stress tests on major banks to evaluate their efficacy in coping with numerous negative financial situations without defaulting. These tests revealed some banks lacked sufficient reserve funds. (Soon after these findings, banks began to hike fees and credit card rates to accumulate more capital.) Remember, if banks couldn't utilize deposited funds (by lending it out, investing it, etc.), this would significantly alter the existing financial environment.\n",

What I mean is that whatever Delaware does to get in the news about its easy business laws, has been mimicked and done even better by other states by this point in time.

Many kinds of businesses still require a bank account for domestic and global trade. Many don't require any financial intermediary any more to receive payments. But if you do need this, then opening a bank account in the United States will be more difficult. Again, the registered agent or lawyer can get a Tax Identification Number for you from the IRS, and this will be necessary to open a US bank account.

Find a way to invest for a low starting amount via a retirement account (such as a 401K or IRA in the United States) or non-retirement account. Use this money to buy individual stocks or funds. Every month put money from your regular income into this investment account. Then buy more stocks or sell if the conditions change based on what the market is doing, not to meet a loan payment. This helps you because if the price fluctuates you will buy more shares if the price is down; and you will buy fewer shares when the price is up. It also allows you to skip worrying about how to repay the loan. It also means that you not have to pull more money out of savings to make the final loan payments if it doesn't make as much money as you plan. Regarding your math.

Even if you have short term credit funds, it'd still be wiser to lever up the house completely as long as you're not overpaying or in a bubble area, considering your ample personal investments and the combined rate of return of the house and the funds exceeding the mortgage interest rate.  Also, mortgage interest is tax deductible while margin interest isn't, pushing the net return even higher. $125k Generally, I recommend this figure to you because the biggest S&P collapse since the recession took off about 50% from the top.  If you borrow $125k on margin, and the total value of the funds drop 50%, you shouldn't suffer margin calls. I assumed that you were more or less invested in the S&P on average (as most modern \"asset allocations\" basically recommend a back-door S&P as a mix of credit assets, managed futures, and small caps average the S&P). Second mortgage Yes, you will have two loans that you're paying interest on. You've traded having less invested in securities & a capital gains tax bill for more liabilities, interest payments, interest deductions, more invested in securities, a higher combined rate of return. If you have $500k set aside in securities and want $500k in real estate, this is more than safe for you as you will most likely have a combined rate of return of ~5% on $500k with interest on $500k at ~3.5%.  If you're in small cap value, you'll probably be grossing ~15% on $500k. You definitely need to secure your labor income with supplementary insurance.  Start a new question if you need a model for that. Secure real estate with securities A local bank would be more likely to do this than a major one, but if you secure the house with the investment account with special provisions like giving them copies of your monthly statements, etc, you might even get a lower rate on your mortgage considering how over-secured the loan would be. You might even be able to wrap it up without a down payment in one loan if it's still legal.  Mortgage regulations have changed a lot since the housing crash.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  If your downpayment requirement is less than $125k, my suggestion would be to convert your shares in mutual funds to their equivalent ETFs tax-free. Wondering if it's possible to convert ordinary Vanguard mutual fund shares into Vanguard ETFs? If you possess traditional shares of Vanguard's stock index funds that offer Vanguard ETFs, you're allowed to switch these shares into similar Vanguard ETFs. The exchange is typically tax-free, although certain brokerage firms might be unable to convert fractional shares, potentially resulting in a small taxable gain. Note that four of our bond ETFs—Total Bond Market, Short-Term Bond, Intermediate-Term Bond, and Long-Term Bond—do not permit the conversion from bond index fund shares to bond ETF shares of the same fund. All other Vanguard bond ETFs do. For clients of Vanguard Brokerage, this conversion service from conventional shares to Vanguard ETFs of the same type comes for free. Other brokerage services might exact a fee. For further details, get in touch with your brokerage firm, or dial 866-499-8473. It’s important to be aware that this process is irreversible. After transitioning from standard shares to Vanguard ETFs, there's no turning back. Also, traditional shares in a 401(k) account cannot be converted. You can find more information at https://personal.vanguard.com/us/content/Funds/FundsviperWhatAreVIPERSharesJSP.jsp. You can then take a margin loan for the amount needed and purchase the property. Once the house is purchased, secure a second mortgage of $125k, use the money from this second mortgage to clear the margin loan. It is advisable to fully leverage the property, given your significant personal investments and the combined return on your house and investments exceeding the interest rate on the mortgage. Even with short-term credit funds, it will still be more beneficial to completely leverage the house unless you are overpaying or in an area prone to housing bubbles. Also, mortgage interest can be deducted from taxes as opposed to margin interest, contributing to a higher net return. I advocated the $125k figure based on the greatest S&P downfall since the recession saw a 50% reduction from peak values. If a margin loan of $125k is taken, a 50% drop in the funds' total value won't trigger a margin call. I've supposed your assets are dispersed in S&P in general as advised under modern “asset allocation\". Yes, you will be paying interest on two different loans, but trading lower securities investments and capital gain taxes for liabilities, interest payments and deductions, higher securities investments, and increased combined return rate could yield a higher net return. Say, if you have $500k invested in securities and desired to invest the same amount into real estate, this strategy is safe considering an expected combined return rate of approximately 5% on your $500k and interest charged on your $500k at roughly 3.5%. In case of investments in small-cap value, the gross yield could be around 15% on your $500k. It's critical to secure your wage income with extra insurance. Consult further for this if required. Securing the house with your investment account, with specific arrangements such as monthly statement copies, could even fetch you lower mortgage interest rates considering the security of the loan. Under certain circumstances, a down payment might even be avoidable if legally permitted. Bear in mind, mortgage regulations have vastly changed since the previous housing downturn.\n",

      "Reference Response:  What is the best way that I can invest money so that I can always get   returns? If you want something that doesn't require any work on your end, consider having a fee-only financial planner make a plan so that your investments can be automated to generate a cash flow for you or get an annuity as the other classic choices here as most other choices will require some time commitment in one form or other. Note that for stock investments there could be rare instances like what happened for a week in September in 2001 where the markets were closed for 5 days straight that can be the hiccup in having stocks. Bonds can carry a risk of default where there have been municipalities that defaulted on debt as well as federal governments like Russia in the 1990s. Real estate may be subject to natural disasters or other market forces that may prevent there always being a monthly payment coming as if you own a rental property then what happens if there aren't tenants because there was an evacuation of the area? There may be some insurance products to cover some of these cases though what if there are exceptionally high claims all at once that may have an insurance company go under? Would it be to set up an FD in a bank, to buy land, to buy a rental   house, to buy a field, or maybe to purchase gold?  What investment of your own time do you plan on making here? Both in terms of understanding what your long-term strategy is and then the maintenance of the plan. If you put the money in the bank, are you expecting that the interest rate will always be high enough to give you sufficient cash to live as well as having no financial crisis with the bank or currency you are using? Are there any better investments? You may want to reconsider what assumptions you want to make and what risks you want to accept as there isn't likely to be a single solution here that would be perfect.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  How can I optimally invest my money to ensure it consistently yields returns? If you prefer a hands-off approach, you could use a fee-only financial planner to create an investment strategy that automatically generates income, or you could look into purchasing an annuity which tends to be a popular option. However, most investment avenues require some degree of time and effort. It's worth noting that stock investments may present occasional challenges; for example, market closures like the one in September 2001 that lasted five consecutive days. Bond investments may also contain risks associated with defaults, as has happened with certain municipalities and even countries like Russia in the 1990s. Real estate, though generally solid, can also be susceptible to natural events or market dynamics that could prevent steady payments. Examples include tenant-less rental properties caused by evacuations. Although insurance products could offer some level of coverage against such situations, high claim incidents could potentially destabilize an insurance company. Should you go with a Fixed Deposit in a bank, land purchase, rental property, an agriculture field, or maybe gold? What time commitment do you envisage for this investment? This covers both understanding your long-term strategy and maintaining the strategy thereafter. If you decide on banking, are you confident that the interest rate will always suffice to provide you with a steady income, with no financial crashes affecting the bank or currency? Are there more effective investment options? It will aid you greatly to review the underlying assumptions and risks you are willing to face since it's unlikely that one single investment will meet all your needs perfectly.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The answer probably varies with local law, and you haven't said where you're located. In most or all US states, it appears that after some statutory length of time, the bank would transfer the money to the state government, where it would be held indefinitely as \"unclaimed property\" in the name of the recipient (technically, the payee, the person to whom the check is made payable).  This process is called escheatment.  Most states publish a list of all unclaimed property, so at some later date the payee could find their name on this list, and realize they were entitled to the funds.  There would then be a process by which the payee could claim the funds from the state.   Usually the state keeps any interest earned on the money. As far as I know, there typically wouldn't be any way for you, the person who originated the payment, to collect the money after escheatment.  (Before escheatment, if you have the uncashed check in your possession, you can usually return it to the bank and have it refunded to you.) I had trouble finding an authoritative source explaining this, but a number of informal sources (found by Googling \"cashier check escheatment\") seem to agree that this is generally how it works.  Here is the web site for a law firm, saying that in California an uncashed cashier's check escheats to the state after 3 years. Until escheatment occurs, the recipient can cash the check at any time.  I don't think that cashier's checks become \"stale\" like personal checks do, and there isn't any situation in which the funds would automatically revert to you.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The exact procedure might differ depending on your jurisdiction, and you've yet to mention your location. However, in most or perhaps every US state, there seems to be a legally defined period after which the bank would pass your money on to the state. It would then be preserved indefinitely as \"unclaimed property\" under the name of the beneficiary - in other words, the payee or the individual to whom the check is addressed. This transition process is known as escheatment. Most states make a compilation of all unclaimed properties public so that the payee may find their name on the list at a later time and realize their rightful claim to the funds. Subsequently, there is a procedure for the payee to recoup the money from the state. Generally, the interest accrued on the money is kept by the state. To my knowledge, once escheatment takes place, you, as the person who initiated the payment, don't have any means to retrieve the money. (Pre-escheatment, if you have the cashable check with you, you can generally give it back to the bank in return for a refund.) Although it was challenging to find a definitive source to clarify this, several casual information sources found on Google using the term \"cashier check escheatment\" seem to agree that it's largely how the process unfolds. One law firm's website, for example, states that uncashed cashier's check in California escheats to the state after a span of three years. The beneficiary can cash the check at any point until escheatment. I don't believe cashier's checks lose their validity similar to personal checks, and there isn't any scenario where the funds would default back to you.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I'll use similar logic to Dave Ramsey to answer this question because this is a popular question when we're talking about paying off any debt early.  Also, consider this tweet and what it means for student loans - to you, they're debt, to the government, they're assets. If you had no debt at all and enough financial assets to cover the cost, would you borrow money at [interest rate] to obtain a degree?  Put it in the housing way, if you paid off your home, would you pull out an equity loan/line for a purchase when you have enough money in savings?  I can't answer the question for you or anyone else, as you can probably find many people who will see benefits to either. I can tell you two observations I've made about this question (it comes a lot with housing) over time.  First, it tends to come up a lot when stocks are in a bubble to the point where people begin to consider borrowing from 0% interest rate credit cards to buy stocks (or float bills for a while).  How quickly people forget what it feels (and looks like) when you see your financial assets drop 50-60%!  It's not Wall Street that's greedy, it's most average investors.  Second, people asking this question generally overlook the behavior behind the action; as Carnegie said, \"Concentration is the key to wealth\" and concentrating your financial energy on something, instead of throwing it all over the place, can simplify your life.  This is one reason why lottery winners don't keep their winnings: their financial behavior was rotten before winning, and simply getting a lot of money seldom changes behavior.  Even if you get paid a lot or little, that's irrelevant to success because success requires behavior and when you master the behavior everything else (like money, happiness, peace of mind, etc) follows.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In addressing this common question about the early repayment of any type of debt, I will draw on the reasoning similar to person like Dave Ramsey. Take a moment to mull over this tweet's implications for student loans – they may be a liability for you, but to the government, they're assets. Suppose you had no outstanding debts and enough resources to afford your expenses; would you take a loan at [interest rate] to earn a degree? In housing terms, if your house was fully paid off, would you extract a home equity loan/line to finance a purchase even when you have a substantial amount saved? I can't provide a definite answer for individuals because the benefits can be seen differently by different people. However, I can share two points based on my observation around this subject (which often arises in the context of housing). Primarily, this question often surfaces when the stock market is at its peak and people are tempted to borrow from 0% interest credit cards to invest in stocks (or temporarily suspend their bills). People seem to forget how it feels (and appears) to witness their financial holdings plummet by 50-60%! It's not Wall Street that's temperamentally avaricious; it is the most typical investors. Moreover, those who pose this question often neglect the influence of underlying behavior; echoing Carnegie's sentiment, \"Concentration is the key to wealth,\" and centering your fiscal focus on a particular area rather than scattering it can simplify your life. This notion underpins why lottery winners usually fail to hold onto their fortunes: their prior financial conduct was defective and merely amassing a significant sum rarely transforms this behavior. Irrespective of your earnings, this doesn't determine success because success is behavioral, and success in that often leads to other gains (e.g., money, happiness, peace of mind).\n",

      "Reference Response:  Which is generally the better option (financially)? Invest. If you can return 7-8% (less than the historical return of the S&P 500) on your money over the course of 25 years this will outperform purchasing personal property. If you WANT to own a house for other reason apart from the financial benefits then buy a house. Will you earn 7-8% on your money, there is a pretty good chance this is no because investors are prone to act emotionally.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  From a financial perspective, investing is typically the superior choice. Should you manage to secure a 7-8% return (which is lower than the S&P 500's historical return) on your investment over a 25-year span, this would surpass the gains realized by buying personal property. Should you desire to buy a house for reasons beyond sheer financial advantage, then by all means proceed.

      "Reference Response:  I completely agree with Pete that a 401(k) loan is not the answer, but I have an alternate proposal: Reduce your 401(k) contribution down to the 4% that you get a match on.  If you are cash poor now and have debts to be cleaned up, those need to be addressed before retirement savings.  You'll have plenty of time to make up the lost savings after you get the debts paid off.   If your company matches 50% (meaning you have to contribute 8% to get the 4% match), then consider temporarily stopping your 401(k) altogether. A 100% match is very hard to give up, but a 50% match is less difficult.  You have plenty of years left ahead of you to make up the lost match.  Plus, the pain of knowing you're leaving money on the table will incentivize you to get the loans paid as quickly as possible.  It seems to me that I would be reducing middle to high interest debt while also saving myself $150 per month.  No, you'd be deferring $150 per month for an additional two years, and not reducing debt at all, just moving it to a different lender. Interest rate is not your problem.  Right now you're paying less than $30 per month in interest on these 3 loans and about $270 in principal, and at the current rate should have them paid off in about 2 years.  You're wanting to extend these loans to 4 years by borrowing from your retirement savings.   I would buckle down, reduce expenses wherever possible (cable? cell phone? coffee? movies? restaurants?) until you get these debts paid off.  You make $70,000 per year, or almost $6,000 per month.  I bet if you try hard enough you can come up with $1,100 fairly quickly. Then the next $1,200 should come twice as fast. Then attack the next $4,000. (You can argue whether the $1,200 should come first because of the interest rate, but in the end it doesn't matter - either one should be paid off very quickly, so the interest saved is negligible) Maybe you can get one of them paid off, get yourself some breathing room, then loosen up a little bit, but extending the pain for an additional two years is not wise. Some more drastic measures:\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Pete's stance against 401(k) loans is something that I fully support. However, I suggest a different approach: Lower your 401(k) contribution to the 4% matching level. Given the current state of cash shortage and debt, these issues must be resolved before considering retirement savings. Once your debts are paid off, you will have ample time to recoup the lost savings. If there's a 50% company match stipulating an 8% contribution for a 4% match, you may want to consider pausing your 401(k) completely for some time. It's tough to let go of a 100% match, but relinquishing a 50% match is less challenging. The lost match could later be recovered, given the multiple years left for retirement. Moreover, the regret of having lost potential money would motivate you to clear off the debts faster. To me it seems like, by doing this, I could trim down the interest-heavy debt while saving approximately $150 a month. But contrarily, you're postponing the $150 monthly payment for an additional couple of years, and not actually reducing the debt; merely shifting it to another lender. The interest rate is not the main issue. Currently, you're paying just under $30 in interest and about $270 towards the principal per month for these 3 loans. These should ideally be cleared in about 2 years at the current pace. Your inclination to stretch these loans to 4 years by borrowing from your retirement savings isn't advisable. I urge you to tighten your belt, cut costs wherever you can (cable, mobile phone, coffee, movies, restaurants, etc.), and focus on clearing these debts. You earn around $70,000 annually, which equates to almost $6,000 per month. I'm confident that, with a dedicated effort, you can quickly save $1,100. Next, gather $1,200, which should be easier, and then target the remaining $4,000. There's debate over whether the $1,200 should be accumulated first due to the interest rate, but ultimately it's irrelevant - either amount could be paid off rapidly, rendering any potential interest savings insignificant. Perhaps aim to pay off one of these to create some financial flexibility. A two-year extension of the financial burden isn't advisable. You might want to consider more radical strategies.\n",

      "Reference Response:  If the business is being investigated by your state's Attorney General's office, then your first call should be to that office.  They will be able to help you in a few ways, even if they can't explicitly resolve the situation, and they also would undoubtedly appreciate your information to add to their case as well. First, they may be able to tell you how other victims have had their cases resolved, particularly if any went to court on their own.  While they won't be able to provide you with personal information of the other victims unless it is public knowledge (via a court case), the information about how the other victims resolved the cases may be helpful - both to show what to do, and what not to do. Second, they may be able to put you in contact with an attorney who is handling other cases like yours. That may reduce the cost of the attorney (as they'll have already done some of the work), and may mean that the attorney is willing to work with no up front fee on the assumption of winning the case. Third, if there are options for getting your money back without a court case, the AG's office may be able to help provide those as well. If the Attorney General's office is unable to help you, then your best bet is to contact an attorney on your own - look for one who specializes in consumer protection and fraud.  This is the purpose attorneys exist for: pursuing your interests against another's.  Let them do their job.  Do make an effort to find a good, honest attorney; you may find some help on how to do this on law.se if you need it (not actual recommendations, mind you, just help with how you would go about finding one).  It sounds like your claim would be above and beyond the level of a small claims court lawsuit, but verify this in your jurisdiction; if small claims court goes up to $10,000, you may be able to pursue it there on your own - but I would still get some help from an attorney, at least finding out what you would need to win.\n",

They are a useful resource, capable of guiding you, even if a direct resolution is out of their grasp and your contribution to their investigation would certainly be valuable. Initially, they could potentially offer insight into how others in a similar situation have resolved their cases, especially those who have independently sought legal recourse. Although they are unable to divulge personal information of these individuals unless it is publicly accessible, the description of how cases were concluded might prove informative, guiding you what move to make or avoid. In addition, they could suggest an attorney well-versed in equivalent cases as yours. This could lower your legal expenses due to their prior knowledge of the scenario and might persuade them to work without a front-loaded charge based on the case's potential win. Additionally, they could suggest alternative means of reclaiming your money without needing to go to court. If the Attorney General's office lacks the proper assistance, your next course of action should be to engage your own attorney, preferably one with expertise in consumer defense and fraud matters. This is the very essence of their existence: to protect your rights. Let them fulfill their duty. Endeavor to secure a reputable attorney; guidance on the selection process can be found on law.se if required (note that it does not suggest names, merely assists in the search). It appears that your case may surpass the threshold of a small claims lawsuit, though this needs verification based on your local laws; if small claims court covers damages up to $10,000, you might be able to handle it autonomously - although I still recommend legal counsel for understanding what you need for a win.\n",

This definition is from John Hull, Options, Futures and Other Derivatives – a book definitely worth to own if you are curious about this, you can easily find old copies for a few dollars. The first point is that a derivative is a financial instrument, like credits, or insurances, the second point is that its price depends closely from the price of something else, the mentioned asset. In most cases derivatives can be understood as financial insurances against some risk bound to the asset. In the sequel I give a small list of derivatives and highlight the assets and the risk they can be bound to.  And first, let me point out that the definition is (marginally) wrong because some derivatives depend on things which are not assets, nor do they have a price, like temperature, sunlight, or even your own life in the case of mortgages.  But before going in this list, let me go through the remaining points of your question. What is the basic idea and concept behind a derivative? As already noted, in most cases, a derivative can be understood as a financial insurance compensating from a risk of some sort.  In a classical insurance contract, one party of the contract is an insurance company, but in the broader case of a derivative, that counterparty can be pretty anything: an insurance, a bank, a government, a large company, and most probably market makers. How is it really used, and how does this deviate from the first point? Briefly, how does is it affecting people, and how is it causing problems? An important point with derivatives is that it can be arbitrarily complicated to compute their prices.  Actually what is hidden in the attempt of giving a definition for derivatives, is that they are products whose price Y is a measurable function of one or several random variables X_1, X_2, … X_n on which we can use the theory of arbitrage pricing to get hints on the actual price Y of the asset – this is what the depends on means in technical terms.  In the most favorable case, we obtain an easy formula linking Y to the X_is which tells us what is the price of our financial instrument. But in practice, it can be very difficult, if at all possible, to determine a price for derivatives. This has two implications: Persons possessing sophisticated techniques to compute the price of derivatives have a strategic advantage on derivatives market, in comparison to less advanced actors on the market. Organisation owning assets they cannot price cannot compute their bilan anymore, so that they cannot know for sure their financial situation. They are somehow playing roulette. But wait, if derivatives are insurances they should help to mitigate some financial risk, which precisely means that they should help their owners to more accurately see their financial situation! How is this not a contradiction? Some persons with sophisticated techniques to compute the price of derivatives are actually selling complicated derivatives to less knowledgeable persons.  For instance, many communes in France and Germany have contracted credits whose reimbursements have a fixed interest part, like in a classical credit, and a variable interest part whose rate is computed against a complicated formula involving the value of the Swiss frank at each quarter starting from the inception of the credit.  (So, for a 25 years running credit of theis type, the price Y of the credit at its inception depends on 100 Xs, which are the uncertain prices for the Swiss frank each quarter of the 25 next years.)  Some of these communes can be quite small, with 5.000 inhabitants, and needless to say, do not have the required expertise to analyse the risks bound to such instruments, which in that special case led the court call the credit a swindling and to cancel the credit.  But what chain of events leads a 5.000 inhabitants city in France to own a credit whose reimbursements depends on the Swiss frank?  After the credit crunch in 2007 and the fall of Lehman Brothers in 2008, it has begun to be very hard to organise funding, which basically means to conclude credits running long in time on large amounts of money.  So, the municipality needs a 25 years credit of 10.000.000 EUROS and goes to its communal bank.  The communal bank has hundreds or thousands of municipalities looking for credits and needs itself a financing.  So the communal bank goes to one of the five largest financial institutions in the world, which insists on selling a huge credit whose reimbursements have a variable part depending on hundred of values the Swiss frank will have in the 25 next years. Since the the big bank has better computation techniques than the small bank it makes a big profit.  Since the small bank has no idea, how to compute the correct price of the credit it bought, it cuts this in pieces and sell it in the same form to the various communes it works with.  If we were to attribute this kind of intentions to the largest five banks, we could ask about the possibility that they designed the credit to take advantage of the primitive evaluation methods of the small bank. We could also ask if they organised a cartel to force communal banks to buy their bermudean snowballs. And we could also ask, if they are so influent that they eventually can manipulate the Swiss frank to secure an even higher profit.  But I will not go into this.  To the best of my understanding, the subprime crisis is a play along the same plot, with different actors, but I know this latter subject only by what I could read in French newspapers. So much for the “How is it causing problems?” part. What is some of the terminology in relation to derivatives (and   there meanings of course)? Answering this question is basically the purpose of the 7 first chapters of the book by Hull, along with deriving some important mathematical principles.  And I will not copy these seven chapters here! How would someone get started dealing in derivatives (I'm playing a     realistic stock market simulation, so it doesn't matter if your     answer to this costs me money)? If you ask the question, I understand that you are not a professional, so that your are actually trying to become the one that has money and zero knowledge in the play I outlined above. I would recommand not doing this.  That said, if you have a good mathematical background and can program well, once you are confindent with the books of Hull and Joshi, you can have fun implementing various market models and implementing trading strategies. Once you are confident with this, you can also read the articles on quantitative finance on arXiv.org. And once you are done with this, you can decide for yourself if you want to play the same market as the guys writing these articles. (And yes, even for the simplest options, they have better models than you have and will systematically outperform you in the long run, even if some random successes will give you the feeling that you do well and could do better.) (indeed, I've made it a personal goal to somehow lose every last cent of my money) You know your weapons! :) Two parties agree today on a price for one to deliver a commodity to the other at some future instant.  This is a classical future contract, it can be modified in every imaginable way, usually by embedding options.  For instance one party could have the option to choose between different delivery points or delivery days. Two parties write today a contract allowing the one party to buy at some future time a commodity to the the second party.  The price is written today, as part of the contract.  (There is the corresponding option entitling the owner to sell something.)  Unlike the future contract, only one party can be obliged to do something, the other jas a right but no obligation. If you buy and option, your are buying some sort of insurance against a change of price on some asset. This is the most familiar to anybody.  Credits can come in many different flavours, especially the formula to compute interests, or also embed options.  Common options are early settlement options or restructuration options. While this is not completely inutitive, the credit works like an insurance.  This is most easily understood from the side of the organisation lending the money, that speculates that the ratio of creanciers going bankrupt will be low enough for her to make profit, just like a fire insurance company speculates that the ratio of fire accidents will be low enough for her to make a profit. This is like a mortgage on a financial institution.  Two parties agree that one will recive an upfront today and give a compensation to the second one if some third party defaults. Here this is an explicit insurance against the unfortuante event, where a creancier goes bankrupt. One finds here more or less standard options on electricity. But electricity have delicious particularities as it can practically not be stored, and fallout is also (usually) avoided. As for classical options, these are insurances against price moves. A swap is like two complementary credits on the same amount of money, so that it ends up in the two parties not actually exchanging the credit nominal and only paying interest one to the other — which makes only sense if these interests are computed with different formulas. Typical example are fixed rate vs. EURIBOR on some given maturity, which we interpret as an insurance against fluctuations of the EURIBOR, or a fixed rate vs. the exchange ratio between two currencies, which we interpret as an insurance against the two currencies decorrelating. Swaps are the richest and the most generic category of financial derivatives.  The off-the-counter market features very imaginative, very customised insurance products. The most basic form is the insurance against drought, but you can image different dangers, and once you have it you can put it in options, in a swap, etc.  For instance, a restaurant with a terrasse could enter in a weather insurance, paying each year a fixed amount of money and becoming in return an amount of money based on the amount of rainy day in a year. Actually, this list is virtually without limits!\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  A derivative is a unique type of financial tool that derives its value from another asset, as John Hull describes in his book, \"Options, Futures and Other Derivatives.\" Like any financial tool, its worth hinges on the value of something else. In most situations, derivatives are like financial insurance against any risks tied to that particular asset. I'll further explain this concept by listing some derivatives and the assets and risks associated with them. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's worth noting that some derivatives rely on things that aren't assets and don't have a specific price, such as temperature, sunlight, or even one's life in the context of mortgages. Now, the crux of a derivative is that it behaves as a form of financial insurance, providing protection against certain types of risks. While typically associated with insurance companies, derivatives can also involve banks, governments, large companies, and others. \n",
      "\n",
      "Derivatives have complexity in determining their costs, and those proficient sophisticated techniques to calculate the rates have an upper hand in the derivatives market. Hence, businesses that own assets they can't price can't accurately evaluate their financial status. Bearing this in mind, let's explore how this impacts individuals and the troubles it can cause. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's look at an example to understand the issue better. Some towns in France and Germany have signed contracts for loans that have a fixed interest rate and a fluctuating rate calculated against a complex formula tied to the value of the Swiss franc. This becomes problematic as these towns cannot analyze the associated risks, leading to legal battles and cancellations. This example demonstrates how these instruments can lead to unforeseen problems and events. \n",
      "\n",
      "As you delve into the world of derivatives, you'll come across a multitude of terms and principles, which you can familiarize with using John Hull's book. If you're striving to make a venture into derivatives, it would be wise to have proficient mathematical and coding skills. Armed with these skills and knowledge from acknowledged experts like Hull and Joshi, you can try your hand at creating market models and trading strategies. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, remember that even the most basic options can be challenging to negotiate, and experienced players will outstrip you in the long run, regardless of any short-term wins. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, let's delve into some types of derivatives. They range from future contracts, where two parties determine a price for future commodity delivery, to options that give one party the choice to buy a commodity at a pre-determined price. Credits can also fall under the derivatives umbrella, as can insurance against third-party default or being tied to commodities such as electricity. A swap is another example - it's essentially two intertwined credits, offering insurance against shifts in exchange rates or other fluctuating factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "From weather insurance to more customized products available on over-the-counter markets, the derivative landscape is expansive and varied, offering a wide array of options for those seeking to mitigate or speculate on financial risks.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I am from Australia, so my answer is based on my experience over here, however it should be similar for the USA. Generally, what determines both the price of houses/apartments and the rents for them is supply and demand. When there is high demand and low supply prices (or rents) generally go up. When there is low demand and high supply prices (or rents) usually go down. What can sometimes happen when house prices go down, is that the demand can drop but so can supply. As the prices drop, developers will make less money on building new houses, so stop building new houses. Other developers can go bankrupt. As less people (including investors) are buying houses, and more people (including investors) try to sell their existing houses, there will be more people looking to rent and less rental properties available to rent. This produces a perfect storm of high demand and low supply of rental properties, causing rents to rise strongly. When the property prices start to go up again as demand increases, there is a shortfall of new properties being built (due to the developers not building during the downturn). At this time developers start to build again but there is a lag time before the new houses can be completed. This lack of supply puts more pressure on both house prices and rents to go up further. Until equilibrium between supply and demand is realised or an oversupply of rental properties exists in the market, rents will continue to rise.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Coming from Australia, my perspective is largely based on experiences here, but the conditions should arguably mirror those in the USA. In essence, housing or apartment prices, as well as rental rates, are largely a function of supply and demand economics. If demand outstrips supply, the result is typically an escalation in prices or rents. Contrarily, when supply outweighs demand, the prices or rents are likely to trend downwards. There's a peculiar scenario where property prices fall, leading to a decrease in both demand and supply. This happens because as prices fall, profits diminish, making it unattractive for property developers to build new homes leading to a cessation in construction. Some developers could even find it unmanageable, leading to bankruptcy. In such conditions, few individuals, including investors, will buy houses, while a great many will look to offload existing ones. This scenario leads to a surplus of people seeking rental properties, while less rental options are available causing a classic case of high demand and low supply that ultimately drives rents upwards. When the tide begins to turn and property prices begin to ascend again due to increasing demand, there is a lag in new construction projects (since many developers would have ceased operations during the slump). The deficiency in supply further amplifies the pressure on house prices and rental rates, pushing them higher. Until a balance between supply and demand is recalibrated, or the market experiences a glut of rental properties, the rental rates will persist in their upward trajectory.\n",

      "Reference Response:  If this money is intended to be used for retirement and depending on how old \"older\" is, it sounds a little risky to be putting too much money in a stock based mutual fund.  While the CDs may seem like crappy investments right now, it is important to down-shift risk as you get closer to retirement because this person won't have as much time to recover if the markets take another big dip.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Assuming that these funds are allocated for post-retirement life, and factoring in the uncertainty of what qualifies as \"older\", it appears a trifle hazardous to invest a large chunk in a mutual fund driven by stocks. Although the appeal of Certificates of Deposit (CDs) might be at a low presently, it's crucial to reduce financial risk as retirement draws near. This strategy is essential since the individual won't have ample time for recuperation should the markets undergo another major slump.\n",

      "Reference Response:  That's what I would do; 1.2 million dollars is a lot of money, but it doesn't make you retired for the rest of your life: There is a big crisis coming soon (my personal prediction) in the next 10-15 years, and when this happens: government will hold your money if you leave them in the bank (allowing you to use just part of it; you will have to prove the reason you need it), government will pass bills to make it very hard to close your investment positions, and government will pass new laws to create new taxes for people with a lot of money (you). To have SOME level of security I would separate my investment in the following: 20% I would buy gold certificates and the real thing (I would put the gold in a safe(s)). 20% I would put in bitcoin (you would have to really study this if you are new to crypto currency in order to be safe). 40% I would invest in regular finance products (bonds, stocks and options, FX). 20% I would keep in the bank for life expenses, specially if you don't want work for money any more. 20% I would invest in startup companies exchanging high risk hoping for a great return. Those percentages might change a little depending how good/confident you become after investing, knowing about business, etc...\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Here's how I'd go about it. Sure, 1.2 million bucks is a substantial amount, but it's not retirement money. There's a considerable turmoil forecasted in my opinion in the coming 10-15 years. If this comes to pass, the government could impose restrictions on your bank savings (restricting your access and demanding proof for your withdrawals), it could enact laws making it difficult for you to liquidate your investments, and it could come up with new taxation laws targeting wealthy individuals like you. To ensure some degree of safety, I'd divide your investment this way. Allocate 20% to purchasing both gold certificates and physical gold (which can be safely stored in a safe). Put another 20% into bitcoin (assuming you're familiar or willing to learn about cryptocurrency for security). Traditional financial products like bonds, stocks, options, and Forex would take up 40% of your investment. Reserve 20% of your funds in the bank for regular expenses, especially if you're thinking of not working for income anymore. Lastly, take a high-risk, high-return gamble by investing the final 20% in startup businesses.

      "Paraphrased Response:  Is it like I'm contrasting apples with oranges? Definitely - distinct objectives, unique laws, varying regulations.

      "Reference Response:  I think you may be drawing the wrong conclusion about why you put what type of investment in a taxable vs. tax-advantaged account. It is not so much about risk, but type of return. If you're investing both tax-advantaged and taxable accounts, you can benefit by putting more tax-inefficient investments inside your tax-advantaged accounts. Some aggressive asset types, like real estate, can throw off a lot of taxable income. If your asset allocation calls for investing in real estate, holding it in a 401k or IRA can allow more of your money to remain invested, rather than having to use it to pay for taxes. And if you're holding in a Roth IRA, you get that tax free. But bonds, a decidedly non-aggressive asset, also throw off a lot of taxable income. You're able to hold them in a tax-advantaged account and not pay taxes on the income until you withdraw it from the account (or tax free in the case of a Roth account.) An aggressive stock fund that is primarily expected to provide returns via price appreciation would do well in a taxable account because there's likely little tax consequence to you until it is sold.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Your assumption regarding the selection of investment for taxable versus tax-advantaged accounts might not be entirely correct. The key deciding factor isn't necessarily risk, but rather the nature of the return you anticipate. If you're directing funds into both tax-advantaged and taxable accounts, it's beneficial to place more tax-inefficient investments within your tax-advantaged accounts. Certain high-risk assets, such as real estate, can produce substantial taxable income. If your investment strategy includes real estate, keeping it in a 401k or IRA will mean more of your cash stays invested instead of being spent on taxes. If you're using a Roth IRA, this can be completely tax-free. However, bonds, which are relatively non-aggressive assets, also generate significant taxable income. Having them in a tax-advantaged account allows you to defer tax payment on the income until you decide to withdraw it from the account (or get it tax-free in a Roth account's scenario). A high-risk stock fund, primarily expected to yield returns through price appreciation, would be suitable for a taxable account, as the likely tax implications may not affect you until the point of sale.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I know that there are a lot service on the internet helping to form an LLC online with a fee around $49. Is it neccessarry to pay them to have an LLC or I can do that myself? No, you can do it yourself. The $49 is for your convenience, but there's nothing they can do that you wouldn't be able to do on your own. What I need to know and what I need to do before forming an LLC? You need to know that LLC is a legal structure that is designed to provide legal protections. As such, it is prudent to talk to a legal adviser, i.e.: a Virginia-licensed attorney. Is it possible if I hire some employees who living in India? Is the salary for my employees a expense? Do I need to claim this expense? This, I guess, is entirely unrelated to your questions about LLC. Yes, it is possible. The salary you pay your employees is your expense. You need to claim it, otherwise you'd be inflating your earnings which in certain circumstances may constitute fraud. What I need to do to protect my company? For physical protection, you'd probably hire a security guard. If you're talking about legal protections, then again - talk to a lawyer. What can I do to reduce taxes? Vote for a politician that promises to reduce taxes. Most of them never deliver though. Otherwise you can do what everyone else is doing - tax planning. That is - plan ahead your expenses, time your invoices and utilize tax deferral programs etc. Talk to your tax adviser, who should be a EA or a CPA licensed in Virginia. What I need to know after forming an LLC? You'll need to learn what are the filing requirements in your State (annual reports, tax reports, business taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes, etc). Most are the same for same proprietors and LLCs, so you probably will not be adding to much extra red-tape. Your attorney and tax adviser will help you with this, but you can also research yourself on the Virginia department of corporations/State department (whichever deals with LLCs).\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I'm aware that numerous internet services offering LLC creation for approximately $49 exist. Is it obligatory to utilize them, or can I handle it independently? There's no necessity to employ them, as you are fully capable of setting up an LLC yourself. Their fee is essentially for convenience. What should I understand and prepare prior to establishing an LLC? The LLC is a legal entity meant to offer legal protections. It's wise to seek advice from a legal expert such as an attorney licensed in Virginia. Can I employ individuals residing in India? Is their salary an expenditure? Should this expense be reported? Although this seems irrelevant to the earlier LLC discussion, yes, hiring individuals in India is feasible. The salaries you provide your employees are indeed expenditures and must be declared to avoid overstatement of profits, which could be considered fraudulent under specific conditions. What should be done to safeguard my company? If you're seeking physical protection, hiring a security personnel would be a valid action. For legal protection, consulting with an attorney would be beneficial. How can I minimize taxes? As a way to reduce taxes, you could vote for politicians who pledge to lower them, although they often fail to follow through. Alternatively, like many others, you could engage in tax planning. This means planning your expenditures, timing your bills, and engaging in tax deferral programs, among other things. This should be discussed with your tax advisor, preferably a Virginia-licensed EA or CPA. What information should I possess post-LLC formation? You are required to understand the filing prerequisites in your state, including annual reports, tax reports, business taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes, and so on. The majority of these requirements are identical for individual owners and LLCs, so it's unlikely you'll encounter much additional red tape. You can rely on your lawyer and tax advisor for assistance, or you can do your own research on the Virginia Department of Corporations or state department responsible for LLC dealings.\n",

      "Reference Response:  This is a reasonable question about inflation.  I would just like to note that inflation is nearly zero at the moment.  And interest rates are very low.  For a stable enterprise, borrowing cash is very easy right now.  Naturally, things could change in a year.  But the reason a company like Microsoft (but not just them) might hoard cash right now is that it gives them weight for buying up smaller firms, muscling rivals, and signaling their comfort level with the way things look for them.  It could also be because they are out of ideas for what to invest in, and/or are waiting for conditions to change before making any big decisions.  But with an interest rate at close to zero, and an inflation rate at close to zero, at the moment, inflation is not going to be a consideration in evaluating such a company.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The query about inflation is indeed a valid one. It's important to highlight that, currently, we're witnessing almost negligible inflation levels. Also, the interest rates are exceptionally low. For a robust business, the ease of acquiring loans is quite significant at present. Of course, the circumstances could evolve over the coming year. The reason a corporation like Microsoft (though not exclusive to them) might be accumulating cash reserves could be because it equips them with the ability to acquire smaller companies, outperform competitors, and demonstrate their confidence with the current market situation. They could also be at a stage where they lack innovative investment prospects, and/or are possibly delaying any significant decisions until there's a shift in the market conditions. However, given that both the inflation and interest rate are verging on zero at this point, inflation wouldn't play a significant role in assessing such a corporation.\n",

Maybe this changes if you pay the tax on the stock on the grant date. See Pub 525: Restricted Property: Choosing to include in income for year of transfer. Obviously, if this is important you should consult your tax advisor.  Technicalities aside, I don't think it passes the sniff test. You're getting salable shares when the restricted stock vests. If you're selling other shares at a loss within 30 days of the vesting date, that smells like a wash sale to me.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Which is relevant- the date of grant or the date of vesting?\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to restricted stock, I believe the date of vesting aligns with the second wash sale trigger as defined by IRS Publication 550 under the section Wash Sales, specifically the point which discusses the acquisition of substantially identical stock or securities in a wholly taxable transaction. This interpretation is based on a couple of passages from IRS Publication 525 under the heading, Restricted Property: firstly, any earnings from the property, or the right to use the property, are counted as extra income in the year when you receive the income or secure the right to use the property. Secondly, until the property becomes significantly vested, it stays in the possession of the individual who has made the transfer to you- often, your employer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, on the vesting date:\n",
      "- the transfer becomes taxable\n",
      "- ownership of the property is shifted to you\n",
      "This seems quite parallel to \"a completely taxable transaction\", in my perspective. Although, this could potentially alter if you pay the tax on the stock on the grant date as suggested by Publication 525: Restricted Property under the point on Choosing to include in income for year of transfer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, it is essential to seek advice from your tax consultant if this issue is critical. Overlooking technical aspects, I don't believe it clears the basic smell test. When your restricted stock matures, you're obtaining shares that can be sold. If you're taking a loss on other shares within 30 days of this vesting date, that to me seems like a wash sale.\n",

      "Reference Response:  There's a grey area where investing and speculating cross. For some, the stock market, as in 10% long term return with about 14% standard deviation, is too risky. For others, not enough action.  Say you have chosen 10 penny stocks, done your diligence, to the extent possible, and from a few dozen this is the 10 you like. I'd rather put $100 into each of 10 than to put all my eggs in one basket. You'll find that 3 might go up nicely, 3 will flounder around, and 4 will go under. The gambler mentality is if one takes off, you have a profit.  After the crash of '08, buying both GM and Ford at crazy prices actually worked, GM stockholders getting nothing, but Ford surviving and now 7X what I bought it for.  Remember, when you go to vegas, you don't drop all your chips on Red, you play blackjack/craps as long as you can, and get all the free drinks you can.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The intersection of speculation and investment is a murky zone. Some consider the stock market, with its 10% long-term return and around 14% standard deviation, too volatile. Yet for others, it's not stimulating enough. Suppose you've selected 10 penny stocks after thorough due diligence, from a wider range, these ten are your preferred picks. I'm more inclined to distribute $100 amongst these stocks rather than focusing all my resources on one. It's likely that 3 may show a promising rise, 3 may stagnate, while 4 might fail. If one flourishes, those with a betting mindset see it as profit. Post the 2008 crash, purchasing both GM and Ford at absurdly low prices turned out to be beneficial, despite GM shareholders receiving no returns. Ford, conversely, survived and is now seven times the purchase price. It's important to keep in mind that one doesn't wager everything on Red when in Vegas; instead, they engage in blackjack or craps for as long as possible, taking advantage of all the free beverages available.\n",

      "Reference Response:  As @ApplePie pointed out in their answer, at any given time there is a finite amount of stock available in a company. One subtlety you may be missing is that there is always a price associated with an offer to buy shares. That is, you don't put in an order simply to buy 1 share of ABC, you put in an order to buy 1 share of ABC for $10. If no one is willing to sell a share of ABC for $10, then your order will go unfilled. This happens millions of times a day as traders try to figure the cheapest price they can get for a stock. Practically speaking, there is always a price at which people are willing to sell their shares. You can put in a market order for 1 share of ABC, which says essentially \"I want one share of ABC, and I will pay whatever the market deems to be the price\". Your broker will find you 1 share, but you may be very unhappy about the price you have to pay! While it's very rare for a market to have nobody willing to sell at any price, it occasionally happens that no one is willing to buy at any price. This causes a market crash, as in the 2007-2008 financial crisis, when suddenly everyone became very suspicious of how much debt the major banks actually held, and for a few days, very few traders were willing to buy bank stocks at any price.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  As @ApplePie explained, a company has a limited amount of shares available at any given moment. You may be overlooking a small detail that a purchase offer always comes with a price tag. In other words, you don't just order to buy 1 share of ABC, but rather specify a price, as in, you intend to acquire 1 share of ABC for $10. If there are no sellers accepting $10 for a share of ABC, your order remains unfulfilled. This scenario unfolds millions of times daily as traders investigate the lowest possible stock price. In practical terms, a price always exists where people are prepared to trade their shares. You can place a market order for 1 share of ABC, essentially stating \"I demand one share of ABC, and I'm ready to pay the market price\". Your broker will secure that one share, but you could end up disappointed by the cost! While it's quite unusual for a market to lack sellers at any rate, there are times when no one is ready to purchase at any price. This state triggers a market crash, like in the 2007-2008 financial turmoil. At that time, mistrust surged over the real scale of major banks’ debt, and for a short period, hardly anyone was willing to invest in bank stocks irrespective of the price.\n",

      "Reference Response:  This stock is the same as any other, but you need to keep clear in your head that you and your company are now different entities.  You (the person) will pay tax on capital gains and losses when you sell any stock that you hold in your own name.  You'll also owe \"regular\" tax if you draw a salary, etc.  The fact that it may be \"your\" company does not change these things. The company will not recognize a gain by selling stock to raise capital since it's nominally exchanging things of equal value, say $100 in cash for $100 in stock.  In order to sell stock, however, you MIGHT need to register with the SEC depending on how you're going about finding your investors, so keep that in mind.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  This equity is identical to any other, but it's crucial to remember that you and your business have now become separate entities. As an individual, any stock you hold in your name will be subject to capital gains and losses tax upon selling. Additionally, if you draw a salary, you'll be liable to pay the usual tax. The reality that it might be \"your\" company makes no difference to these matters. The company won't make a profit from selling stock to gather capital, as it merely swaps goods of the same worth, for example, $100 cash for $100 stock. However, if you plan to sell stock, you MAY have to register with the SEC depending on your strategy for attracting investors. So, it's important to bear that in mind.\n",

      "Reference Response:  First, don't save anything in a tax sheltered vehicle. You will be paying so little tax that there will be essentially no benefit to making the contributions, and you'll pay tax when they come out. Tax free compounding for 40 years is terrific, but start that after you're earning more than a stipend. Second, most people recommend having a month's expenses readily available for emergencies. For you, that would be $1500. If you put $100 a month aside, it will take over a year to have your emergency fund. It's easy to argue that you should pick a higher pace, so as to have your emergency money in place sooner. However, the \"emergencies\" usually cited are things like home repair, car repair, needing to replace your car, and so on. Since you are renting your home and don't have a car, these emergencies aren't going to happen to you. Ask yourself, if your home was destroyed, and you had to replace all your clothes and possessions (including furniture), how much would you need? (Keep in mind any insurance you have.) The only emergency expense I can't guess about is health costs, because I live in Canada. I would be tempted to tell you to get a credit card with a $2000 limit and consider that your emergency fund, just because grad student living is so tight to the bone (been there, and 25 years ago I had $1200 a month, so it must be harder for you now.) If you do manage to save up $1500, and you've really been pinching to do that (walking instead of taking the bus, staying on campus hungry instead of popping out to buy food) let up on yourself when you hit the target. Delaying your graduation by a few months because you're not mentally sharp due to hunger or tiredness will be a far bigger economic hit than not having saved $200 a month for 2 or 3 years. The former is 3-6 months of your new salary, the latter 5-7K. You know what you're likely to earn when you graduate, right?\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Firstly, avoid storing your money in tax-sheltered accounts. As you're in a low tax bracket, the gains will be minimal, and you'll have to pay tax upon withdrawal. While tax-free compounding is beneficial over four decades, practical implementation should wait until your income exceeds the limit of a meager stipend. Secondly, it's commonly advised to have a month's expenditure for unexpected situations. In your case, this would equate to $1500. By setting aside $100 monthly, you'll accumulate this amount in over a year. There's a valid argument to accelerate this process for having your emergency funds sooner. The usual emergencies often include home or car maintenance, or replacing an old car, but as a renter without a car, you're not likely to face these situations. Instead, think about how much it would cost to replace your clothing and belongings, considering any insurance you may have. It's challenging to comment on health expenses, as I am Canadian. My inclination would suggest you get a credit card with a $2000 credit limit, using it as your emergency fund considering the financial vulnerabilities of a graduate student's lifestyle. Once you've managed to save up the $1500, make sure to ease up and not exert yourself excessively (e.g., choosing to walk instead of taking public transport, resisting the temptation to buy food when hungry). Postponing your graduation due to exhaustion or hunger will cost you much more, as it can delay your income from your new job. This is a greater setback compared to not saving $200 monthly for a couple of years, resulting in a potential loss of your new salary for 3-6 months versus 5-7k savings. You're aware of your estimated earnings after graduation, right?\n",

      "Reference Response:  This answer is based on Australian tax, which is significantly different. I only offer it in case others want to compare situations. In Australia, a popular tax reduction technique is \"Negative Gearing\". Borrow from a bank, buy an investment property. If the income frome the new property is not enough to cover interest payments (plus maintenance etc) then the excess each year is a capital loss - which you claim each year, as an offset to your income (ie. pay less tax). By the time you reach retirement, the idea is to have paid off the mortgage. You then live off the revenue stream in retirement, or sell the property for a (taxed) lump sum.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  This response is formulated on the basis of Australian taxation, which varies significantly from other countries. I'm providing it for comparison purposes if anyone wishes. In Australia, a widely used strategy for tax reduction is known as \"Negative Gearing.\" It involves getting a loan from a bank to purchase an investment property. If the revenue generated by the property does not cover interest payments (plus ongoing costs), the excess amount for each year can be claimed as a capital loss, which is then used to offset your income and thereby lessen your tax liability. As you approach retirement, the goal is to have fully repaid the mortgage. After which, it is possible to either live on the rental income during your retirement years or sell the property to receive a lump sum, which will be subject to taxation.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The fundamental underlying difference between a bank and a Ponzi scheme: When a bank lends money and charges interest, people can do things with that borrowed money which are worth it. (Building factories, starting businesses, or just enjoying the comfort and warmth of a single-family home instead of paying rent). This is why fractional-reserve banking is able to work. People may also do things which do not necessarily turn a financial profit (financing large purchases on a credit card) but are worth it in terms of an expenditure. They may also do stupid things (financing useless purchases on a credit card and wasting their money) or otherwise dispose of the money poorly (the new business fails, the home's value plummets, etc). A Ponzi scheme never really bothered to do useful things with the money. Social Security has been mentioned. Part of social security's setup involves the current population of workers paying the current population of retirees; their own retirements will have to be financed by the next generation. This design is not intrinsically a Ponzi scheme: both the population and the economy ought to remain growing for the intermediate future, so there will be at least as much money (and probably much more) for them to pay those bills. Unlike a Ponzi scheme, the idea that it will continue to attract new money to pay out existing claims is a realistic one. The real questions of its sustainability are a matter of specifics: is it collecting enough money to remain functional in the future, or is it outpacing the growth of the economy and the population?\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The essential distinction between a bank and a Ponzi scheme is this: when a bank loans money and imposes interest, individuals can leverage that borrowed capital for worthwhile endeavors such as establishing factories, initiating businesses, or relishing the comfort of their very own homes in lieu of rental payments. This essentially explains why fractional-reserve banking operates effectively. People also may engage in actions that don't necessarily yield financial returns (like making large credit card purchases) but are valuable in terms of expenditures. They might also make unwise decisions (like incurring debt for unnecessary items on a credit card, or squandering their funds), or inadequately manage their money (when a new venture fails or when a home's value significantly drops, etc.). A Ponzi scheme, in contrast, does not really strive to do practical things with its funds. The topic of Social Security is often brought up in this discussion. Social Security's framework includes the current workforce funding the current retirees; their own retirement will have to be supported by the subsequent generation. This structure is not inherently a Ponzi scheme: both the populace and the economy are expected to expand steadily in the near future, ensuring there will be ample funds (probably even more) to settle these obligations. Contrary to a Ponzi scheme, it's realistic to expect that it will continue to draw new investment to meet existing liabilities. The real sustainability concerns boil down to specifics: is it amassing enough money to stay operational for the future, or is it exceeding the economic and population growth?\n",

      "Reference Response:  Once you turn 18 you should open an account in your own name and transfer the assets there. Currently your mom is the one responsible as far as the IRS cares with respect to taxes as it is her name on the account. The taxes due will be based on your mom's tax rate. As a good child you can reimburse your mom for the taxes that she has to on your behalf. Also legally that money currently belongs to her. Any legal judgement against your mom can claim that money and it is not available for using as an asset by you on credit applications and such. A better solution would have been for your mom to open a custodial account in your name. This way the money is still yours (you just don't have control of it until you turn 18). While probably not an issue here, the transferring of money between you and your mom (and then back) is considered a gift by the IRS. If the account was very well funded then you could run into having to deal with the annual gift limit and lifetime gift exclusion. Based on the clarification that the question is in reference to India: while I don't know the particulars of the law in India my advice of transferring the assets when you turn 18 still remains. The main difference that I would see been India and the US would be the gift tax / exclusions. Unless someone else knows otherwise I would still expect the law in India to see the current account as being the property of the mother.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  When you reach the age of 18, it'd be best to establish an account under your own name and shift the assets there. For the time being, your mother is considered responsible for any tax implications, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), given that the account is held under her name. The tax payable will be determined on the basis of your mother's tax bracket. It would be a respectful act on your part to repay your mother for any taxes she incurs on your account. Bear in mind that the existing funds legally belong to your mom. If your mom were to face any legal judgments, the money could be claimed, and it's currently not at your disposal for credit applications or similar needs. A more preferable alternative would have been if your mom created a custodial account with your name on it, enabling the money to remain in your possession, although you wouldn't have control over it until you become 18. Even though it might not be an issue in this case, the movement of money between you and your mom is seen by the IRS as a gift. If the account is significantly high in value, the annual gift limit and lifetime gift exclusion might come into play. Taking into account your query's specific needs concerning India, while I'm unfamiliar with the precise legal parameters in India, I still recommend shifting the assets when you turn 18. The prime difference I would anticipate between India and the U.S. is related to the gift tax and exclusions. Unless otherwise advised, I would anticipate the law in India to classify the existing account as your mother's property.\n",

In addition you may be faced with required minimum distributions from these accounts.  But even before you get to those points you will generally shift the focus of new funds into the retirement account to be more conservative. Depending on the balances in the various accounts and the size of the pension and social security accounts you may even move invested funds from aggressive to conservative investments. The proper proportion of the many different types of investments and revenue streams is open to much debate. During retirement you will be pulling money out of retirement accounts either to support your standard of living or to meet the required minimum distributions. What to sell will be based on either the tax implications or the required distributions that will still maintain the asset allocation you desire.   If your distributions are driven by the law you will be selling enough to meet a specific required $ figure. You will either spend that money or move it into a low interest savings account or a non-retirement investment account. If trying to meet your standard of living expectations you will be selling funds that allow you to keep your desired asset allocation but still have enough to live on.

Based on the sizes of the different accounts and your pension and social security funds, you may even shift your investments from high-risk to safer alternatives. The ideal balance among various investments and revenue sources is subject to lots of debates. While retired, you will withdraw money from your retirement accounts either to maintain your standard of living or to fulfill the required minimal distributions. Whether you decide to liquidate will primarily depend on the tax impacts or the necessary distributions that still uphold your preferred asset allocation. If your withdrawals are law-bound, you will let go of assets sufficient to reach a certain necessary monetary value. This money will then be spent or transferred into a low-yield savings account or a non-retirement investment account. If you are endeavoring to maintain your standard of living, you will sell assets that let you retain your preferred asset allocation but also leave you with enough means to sustain yourself.

The options you mentioned: New roof: You should ask yourself \"what is the potential cost of not getting a new roof?\" If you can save up for it a little at a time, while putting most of the rest of your money to paying off debt, that's what I would do.  Unless, of course, there is damage or risk of damage to your house by not doing it now. Then, you need to do the same measurement (of doing the roof now) against the goal of saving three to six months of expenses.  Especially in your case, with your mortgage underwater, you want to be sure you are prepared should anything happen (for example, losing a job, and potentially being forced to move for a new job). Cars/student loan: (Refer to #3 above — in other words, yes).\n",

I would strongly suggest addressing this list prior to considering any significant discretionary expenditures. If you're missing the first item, prioritize it. Among the options you've presented, one is a new roof. You need to contemplate the potential consequences of not replacing your roof. Incrementally saving for it while mostly utilising your funds for debt repayment would be my course of action. That is, unless there's an imminent risk of harm to your home by not replacing the roof immediately. In such a scenario, you must juxtapose the immediate roof replacement with the objective of having a savings cushion equivalent to three to six months of expenditure. Given that you're in negative equity with your mortgage, being financially prepared for eventualities like unemployment or the need to relocate because of a new job, should be considered.

The way to take advantage of knowing a war is coming is to leave as soon as possible. There are strategic materials that can become valuable in a war, but such investments are generally very specialized and not something an ordinary investor would be in a position to exploit.  The most profitable businesses in war are food, oil, and ammunition.\n",

Defense suppliers might perform better than the majority, although the average is dismal. The best strategy when anticipating a war is to evacuate at the earliest opportunity. There are certain resources that can increase in value during war, but these types of ventures are pretty niche and not typically accessible to the regular investor.

      "Paraphrased Response:  In my view, the compelling argument against acquiring DHA purchases (which I do not categorize as investments) are points 3 and 5 previously noted. The resale market has only other investors who believe it's a decent investment. If you cannot sell to home owners, you've just eliminated the majority of the potential buyers, which drastically impacts your capacity to achieve capital gain from your venture - if you aren't pursuing capital gain, be clear to understand why!

If everyone trading that stock agrees there's a resistance at so-and-so level, and it is on such-and-such scale, then they will trade accordingly and there will really be a support or resistance. So while you can identify them at any time scale (although as a rule the time scale on which you observed them should be similar to the time scale on which you intend to use them), it's no matter unless that's what all the other traders are thinking as well. Especially if there are multiple possible S/P levels for different time scales, there will be no consensus, and the whole system will break down as one cohort ruins the other group's S/P by not playing along and vice versa. But often fundamentals are expected to dominate in the long run, so if you are thinking of trades longer than a year, support and resistance will likely become meaningless regardless. It's not like that many people can hold the same idea for that long anyhow.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The functionality of support and resistance hinges on a collective agreement, akin to a self-realizing prediction. If all traders of a certain stock concur there is a resistance at a given level, on a specific scale, their actions will genuinely create a support or resistance. Although you can pinpoint these elements at any time frame (with the caveat that the timeframe you detect them should mirror the one you plan to use), the key is unanimous consensus among traders. Particularly in cases where varying S/P levels exist for different time scales, lack of agreement can disrupt the entire system when one group disrupts the other by not complying and the other way around. However, in instances of trades surpassing a year, it is usually assumed that fundamental factors will prevail, rendering support and resistance largely irrelevant. Given the unlikelihood of sustaining a single viewpoint for an extended period, not many can uphold the same concept for this duration.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Welcome to Money.SE. I will say upfront, Personal Finance is just that, personal, and you are likely to get multiple, perhaps conflicting, answers. Are you sure the PMI will drop off after 2 years? The rules are specific, and for PMI, when prepayments put you at that 78/80% LTV, your bank can require an appraisal, not automatically drop it. Talk to the banks, get confirmation, and depending what they say, keep hacking away at the mortgage.  After this, I suggest jumping on Roth IRAs. You are in the 15% bracket, and the Roth will let you deposit $5500 for each you and your wife. A great way to kickstart a higher level of retirement savings.  After this, I'm not comfortable with the emergency savings level. If you lose your job tomorrow (Funny story, my wife and I lost our's on the same day 3 years ago) and don't have enough savings (Our retirement accounts were good to just retire that day) you can easily run out of money and be late on the mortgage. It's great to prepay the mortgage to get rid of that PMI, but once there, I'd do the Roth and then focus on savings. 6 months expenses minimum.  We have a great Q&A here titled Oversimplify it for me: the correct order of investing in which I go in to more detail, as do 4 other members.  I am not getting on the \"investments will return more than your mortgage cost\" soapbox. A well-funded emergency fund is a very conservative bit of advice.

Need comparison references you should have nearly 1 year's salary (90K) saved toward retirement.  Any question on my advice, add a comment and I will edit in more details.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Welcome to our Money.SE community. Right off the bat, it's crucial to understand that Personal Finance is, indeed, personal, and it's possible you'll receive a variety of, and possibly diverging, responses. Are you convinced that PMI will be removed after 2 years? There are very specific rules for this. For example, if your prepayments reach that 78/80% LTV mark, your bank may insist on an appraisal rather than having it removed automatically. I’d advise you to clarify this with your bank, get substantiation and, based on the information they provide, continue to whittle down the mortgage. Following this, I’d recommend considering setting up Roth IRAs. At the 15% bracket, Roth allows both you and your spouse to deposit $5500 each. This is an excellent means to elevate your retirement savings. Post this, I have concerns about the level of emergency savings you maintain. Should you unexpectedly become unemployed (Coincidentally, my spouse and I both were made redundant on the same day 3 years prior), and your savings aren't sufficient (Although our retirement funds were adequate to retire that day), you could quickly exhaust your financial reserves and fall behind on mortgage payments. While it's commendable to prepay the mortgage to eliminate the PMI, I'd advise, once achieving this, you turn your focus to Roth and subsequently, savings - a minimum of 6 months worth of expenses. To further clarify this, we have a comprehensive Q&A post titled Oversimplify it for me: the correct order of investing where I have provided additional details along with four other community members. I won't be climbing up on the “investments yield greater returns than the cost of your mortgage” soapbox, but I do firmly believe in the importance of a sizeable emergency fund, which is a somewhat conservative financial recommendation. When there is no matched 401(k), a balanced approach of Roth savings and prepayments would be my suggested method. Drawing from another informative post “Ideal net worth by age X? Need comparison references”, you should ideally have close to a year's salary, about 90k, saved towards retirement.

In some other countries (like Hong Kong, Israel, and the US) commercial banks were issuing the currency at some point of time, but now the governments do that. The problem with commercial banks issuing currency is the control. If a bank is allowed to print money - how can the amount of currency be controlled? If it is controlled by the government then the bank will be just a printing press, so what's the point? And since governments now want to control the monetary policy, banks have no reason to just be printing presses for the government, the governments have their own. edit Apparently in Hong Kong it is still the case, as I'm sure it is in some other places in the world as well.\n",

In other regions, such as Hong Kong, Israel, and the United States, there was a period when commercial banks were in charge of issuing currency, however, presently, it's the governments that undertake this role. One major issue with permitting commercial banks to distribute currency is maintaining control. How would we regulate the volume of money if a bank is given permission to fabricate it? If this responsibility is held by the government, then the bank merely serves as a printing station, defeating its purpose. Since current governments desire to manage monetary policy, they now don't need banks to serve just as a medium for producing money — the governments have their own methods.

If you have a total of $10,000 in revolving credit (ie: credit card line) and you ever have more than 50% (or 33% to be conservative) on the card at any time then your credit score will be negatively impacted. This will be a negative impact even if you charge it on day one and pay it off in full on day 2.  Doesn't make much sense but credit companies are playing the averages:  on average they find that people who get close to maxing their credit limit are in some sort of financial trouble. You're better off to make small purchases each month, under $100, and pay them off right away.  That will build a better credit history - and score.\n",

If you own $10,000 in rolling credit (say: credit card limit) and at any point you exceed a usage of 50% (or even 33%, considering a conservative stance), this will negatively affect your credit score. Such a downturn occurs regardless of whether you accrue the charges on the first day and repay it entirely on the second one. While it may not sound logical, credit companies operate on the basis of averages: generally, individuals nearing their credit limit are often financially unstable. It's more favorable to regularly make tiny purchases, not exceeding $100, and clear them instantly. This tactic will enhance your credit history - and consequently, your score.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Assuming the data you're referring to is this line: the difference might be related to the different exchanges on which the stock trades.  FINRA could be listing the reported volume from one exchange, while the NASDAQ data might be listing the volume on all exchanges. This is an important distinction because AAV is a Canadian company that is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE. The Q at the end of the line stands for NASDAQ, according to FINRA's codebook for those data. My guess is that the FINRA data is only reporting the volume for the NASDAQ exchange and not the total volume for all exchanges (Toronto, NASDAQ, NYSE, etc.) while the data straight from NASDAQ, oddly enough, is reporting the total volume. However, FINRA could also face reporting discrepancies, since it's a regulatory body and therefore might not have the most up-to-date volume data that the various exchanges can access.  I don't know if it's related or not, but looking at the NASDAQ historical data, it looks like the volume on March 6, the day you're asking about, was much lower than the volume in most of the days immediately before or after it. For all I know, something might have happened that day concerning that particular stock or the market as a whole. I don't remember anything in particular, but you never know.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  If the data you're referencing pertains to this detail: one possibility is that the variation can be attributed to the differential trading platforms where the stocks are exchanged. FINRA's listing may show the accounted volume from a single exchange, on the other hand, the info from NASDAQ might depict the volume from all exchanges. This distinction is crucial, given that AAV is a Canadian firm, listed on both, the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE. Here, Q signifies NASDAQ, per FINRA's data notation guide. It seems to me that the data from FINRA solely covers the volume for the NASDAQ exchange and excludes aggregating full volumes from all exchanges (Toronto, NASDAQ, NYSE and others), whereas the info directly from NASDAQ, surprisingly, portrays the comprehensive volume. Conversely, FINRA might run into reporting discrepancies, owing to its regulatory nature, hence, it might lack the latest volume information that can be accessed by the individual exchanges. I'm unsure if it's related, but when I checked NASDAQ's historical data, it seems that the volume on March 6, the date you're inquiring about, was significantly lower than most of the days that immediately preceded or followed it. It's possible that something unusual happened that day specific to that stock or the stock market in general. While I don't recall any specific incident, it's certainly conceivable.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Institutions and market makers tend to try and stay delta neutral, meaning that for every options contract they buy or write, they buy or sell the equivalent underlying asset. This, as a theory, is called max pain, which is more of an observation of this behavior by retail investors. This as a reality is called delta hedging done by market makers and institutional investors. The phenomenom is that many times a stock gets pinned to a very even number at a particular price on options expiration days (like 500.01 or 499.99 by closing bell). At options expiration dates, many options contracts are being closed (instutitions and market makers are typically on the other side of those trades, to keep liquidity), so for every one standard 100 share contract the market maker wrote, they bought 100 shares of the underlying asset, to remain delta neutral. When the contract closes (or get rid of the option) they sell that 100 shares of the underlying asset. At mass volume of options traded, this would cause noticeable downward pressure, similarly for other trades it would cause upward pressure as institutions close their short positions against options they had bought. The result is a pinned stock right above or below an expiration that previously had a lot of open interest. This tends to happen in more liquid stocks, than less liquid ones, to answer that question. As they have more options series and more strike prices. No, this would not be illegal, in the US attempting to \"mark the close\" is supposedly prohibited but this wouldn't count as it, the effect of derivatives on stock prices is far beyond the SEC's current enforcement regime :) although an active area of research\n",

      "Numerous times, on options expiration days, a stock is observed to settle at a remarkably precise price (for example, 500.01 or 499.99 at closing time). At these expiration dates, many options contracts are being closed out, with institutions and market makers commonly positioned on the opposing side of these trades in order to preserve liquidity. Consequently, for each standard contract of 100 shares that the market maker issued, they purchased 100 shares of the base asset to maintain delta neutrality. When the contract is closed and the option discarded, they also sell these 100 shares. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the high volumes seen in options trading, this can lead to noticeable downward pressure, and in other trades, upward pressure may be seen as institutions cover their short positions against purchased options. This results in a stock settling just above or below an expiration point that had considerable open interest beforehand. This phenomenon is seen more often in more liquid stocks as compared to less liquid ones due to their greater options series and strike prices. \n",

      "Reference Response:  The issue for you seems to be the sequence of events. Presumably, there will be a gain in the fund. In one year, you have a fund worth $100,000 and the $8500 your netted from the $10,000 dividend. (Dividends are taxed at 15% for most of us. If your taxable income is under $38K single, it's $0) An $8500 net return for the year. Now, if there were no initial dividend, and at the end of a full year, your $100K grew to $110K, and then gave you the $10K dividend, you might not be so unhappy. Even on day 2, you now have a fund worth $90K with a basis of $100K, and the promise of future dividends or cap gains. When you sell, the first $10K of gain from this point will effectively be tax free due to this quick drop.  To directly answer the last few sentences, dividends and cap gains are different. And different still, for the way a fund processes them.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  It appears that your concern revolves around the order in which events occur. It's reasonable to infer that there will be some growth in the fund. As an illustration, you had a fund standing at $100,000 after one year, bolstered by the net returns of $8500 from your $10,000 dividend. (With a majority, dividends bear a 15% tax rate. Anyone with a taxable income less than $38K will encounter no taxation) This relates to a net benefit of $8500 for the year. If, however, there was no upfront dividend, your $100K could have seen an increase to $110K over the year, with the $10K dividend handed out then. This would likely have led to greater satisfaction. As could be seen on the second day, your fund is now valued at $90K, holding a base worth of $100K and the prospective feature of more dividends or capital gains. When you ultimately sell, the first $10K worth of profit from now on will, in practice, not be taxed due to the initial drop. For a direct response to the last part, dividends and capital gains hold differences, and the way a fund deals with them varies too.\n",

      "Reference Response:  As a buyer, one of the easiest ways to save on closing costs is to avoid title insurance.  This will only apply if you are a cash buyer, as a mortgage writer will typically require title insurance.   It is also one of the most ill-advised ways to save money.  You need title insurance.   For the most part, there is really no way to truly save on closing costs.  Wrapping costs into a loan, saving on interest or taxes through timing don't truly save money.  Sometimes you can obtain discounts on closing by using an targeted lender, but that may cost you in higher interest rates.   By paying points on your loan, you may increase your costs at closing in order to save money on interest paid.   Certainly you can't discount required, government imposed fees (like doc stamps).   You may be able to shop around and find a bit lower fees for appraisal, credit reports, title company fees, and title insurance.  However, that is a lot of work for not a lot of return.  Title companies seem to be pretty tight lipped about their fees.   The best yield of your time is to get the other party in the transaction to pay your costs.  The market or local tradition may not allow this.  An additional way to lower your costs is to ask the realtors involved to discount their commissions.  However, they could always say \"no\".   The bottom line is transacting real estate is very expensive.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  For a purchaser, one simple method to cut down on closing expenses is to forego title insurance. However, this only applies to those buying outright with cash, as lenders typically mandate title insurance. Despite being an easy way to cut down expenses, it's not advisable as title insurance is a necessity. Fundamentally, there is no genuine method to significantly reduce closing costs. Including expenses into the loan or timing it to save on tax or interest doesn't necessarily equate to actual savings. Occasionally, you might secure discounts on closure by opting for a specific lender, but this might result in steeper interest rates. By upfront payment of points on your loan, you might end up increasing your closing costs with the aim to save on interest over time. Government-imposed fees such as document stamps are non-negotiable. You might be able to find slightly cheaper rates for services like appraisals, credit evaluations, title company charges, etc., by researching extensively, but the potential savings might not warrant the effort. Title companies aren't typically transparent about their fees. A more effective way to save might be to negotiate with the other party in the deal to cover your expenses, but the market conditions or established customs might not permit this. Another method to decrease your expenses is to request a reduction in commission from the realtors involved, although they have the right to refuse. In essence, the cost of dealing in real estate is considerably high.\n",

Or, if one's fixed payment is much larger than the other, and it is a burden, then it should be paid first, but refinancing may be an option. Socially speaking and possibly even economically since it could affect your reputation, it is probably best to either refinance the cosigned loan or pay that off as rapidly as possible. Economically speaking, I would recommend no prepayment since the asset that is leveraged is your mind which will last many decades, probably exceeding the term of the loan, but some caveats must be handled first: Many would disagree, but I finance the way I play poker: tight-aggressive.\n",

Otherwise, if a fixed repayment amount is overwhelmingly larger than the others becoming a burden, then it should be the initial debt to settle, although seeking a refinancing could be a distinctive option. From both a social and potentially economic viewpoint, since reputation could be comprised, it is likely best to either renegotiate the guaranteed loan or extinguish it as swiftly as possible. From a financial perspective, I wouldn't advise for prepayment as the asset used as collateral is your intellect, which has a life span much greater than the debt's term, but care should be taken with some exceptions: Some may argue against it, but my approach to finance is akin to my poker strategy: cautiously assertive.\n",

A \"covered put\" of the form of posting the cash, and spending it to buy at the strike price if the \"put ... is put\" (excercise), might be forbidden by brokerages because, frankly, how do you account for the \"dedicated\" cash?

Likewise, a \"covered put\" which entails setting aside cash to buy at the strike price when the \"put... is put\" (exercised), could be prohibited by brokerages since it's unclear how to administer the \"allocated\" cash. Does it operate like margin or escrow, or something else? I am uncertain how to tackle this within my own company. Consequently, any broker can prohibit it outrightly. This is illuminating when considered alongside the other responses. JoeTaxpayer, as a rough paraphrase, contends 'just because it's lawful doesn't require us to make it available.'

      "Reference Response:  TL;DR: Sure, \"do your own homework\" is sometimes a cop out. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't do our homework. I agree that in many cases this is a cop-out by commentators. However, even if you believe in perfect market efficiency, there is benefit in \"doing your homework\" for many reasons. One of which you already mention in the question: different stocks all with the same \"value\" might have widely ranging risk. Another factor that might vary between stocks is their tax consequences. High dividend stocks might be a better fit for some buyers than others. One stock might be priced at $40 because there is a small chance they might get regulatory approval for a new product. This might make this stock very risky with a 20% of being $150 in 12 months, and a 80% chance of being $20. Another stock might be priced at $40 because the company is a cash cow, declining in revenues but producing a large dividend of $0.40 per quarter. Low risk, but also with some potential tax disadvantages. Another stock might be priced at $40 because it's a high growth stock. This would be less risky than the first example, but more risky than the second example. And the risk would be more generalized, i.e. there wouldn't be one day or one event that would be make or break the stock. In short, even if we assume that the market is pricing everything perfectly, not all stocks are equal and not all stocks are equally appropriate to everyone. Sometimes when we hear an analyst say \"they should have done their homework\" they are really saying \"This was a high risk/high reward stock. They should have known that this had a potential downside.\" And that all assumes that we believe in 100% pure market efficiency. Which many disagree with, at least to some extent. For example, if we instead subscribe to Peter Lynch's theories about \"local knowledge\", we might believe that everyone has some personal fields of expertise where they know more than the experts. A professional stock analyst is going to follow many stocks and many not have technical experience in the field of the company. (This is especially true of small and mid cap stocks.) If you happen to be an expert in LED lighting, it is entirely feasible (at least to me) that you could be able to do a better job of \"doing homework\" on CREE than the analysts. Or if you use a specialized piece of software from a small vendor at work, and you know that the latest version stinks, then you will likely know more than the analyst does. I think it is somewhat akin to going to a doctor. We could say to ourselves \"the doctor is more knowledgeable about me than medicine, I'm just going to do what they tell me to do.\" And 99% of the time, that is the right thing to do. But if we do our \"homework\" anyway, and research the symptoms, diagnoses, and drugs ourselves as well, we can do get benefits. Sometimes we just can express our preferences amongst equal solutions. Sometimes we can ask smarter questions. And sometimes we have some piece of knowledge that the doctor doesn't have and can actually make an important discovery they didn't know. (And, just like investing, sometimes we can also have just enough knowledge to be dangerous and do ourselves harm if we go against the advice of the professionals.)\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In summary, the adage \"do your research\" can often be used as a lame excuse. However, that doesn't refute our responsibility to conduct proper research. I concur that commentators often default to this to avoid detailed explanations. Nonetheless, even if one holds steadfast beliefs in a perfect market economy, undertaking thorough research can be advantageous for numerous reasons. One such reason, which is stated in your query, is that similar \"valued\" stocks might possess vastly different risks. Another differing aspect among stocks could be their tax implications. High dividend yield stocks might be a more suitable choice for some investors compared to others. A stock valued at $40 might be due to a slim possibility of gaining government approval for a new item, which makes the stock exceedingly volatile, with a 20% chance of escalating to $150 in a year, and an 80% probability of declining to $20. A contrasting stock might be valued at $40 due to the company's steady income, even as profits decrease, but it provides a substantial dividend of $0.40 each quarter. This stock possesses less risk but may also carry potential tax disadvantages. Yet another stock priced at $40 might be due to it exhibiting high growth. This would be less risky than the first example, but riskier than the latter. The risk here is not confined to a single day or event that could drastically affect the stock's value. In essence, even if we assume that the market is accurately pricing everything, not all stocks are identical neither are they suitable for everyone. Often when a financial analyst criticizes with the phrase \"they should have conducted thorough research\", they are implying \"This was a high-risk/high-reward stock with potential drawbacks that should've been anticipated\". This notion relies heavily on the belief in a wholly efficient market, a concept which many contest. For instance, if we concur with Peter Lynch's idea of 'local knowledge', we might believe that everyone possesses certain areas of expertise that surpass those of professional analysts. A certified financial analyst who is responsible for numerous stocks may lack in-depth knowledge about a specific sector, particularly pertinent to small and medium enterprises. If you happen to be an expert in LED lighting, it's entirely plausible (to me anyways) that you would do a better job analysing CREE than professional analysts. Or if your work involves operating specialized software from a niche provider and you're dissatisfied with the recent upgrade, you probably possess more insight than the analyst. This is somewhat akin to seeking medical advice. Generally, we rely on the doctors because naturally they possess much better knowledge of medicine compared to us and follow their recommendations wholeheartedly. This approach is effective 99% of the times. However, if we make an effort to understand our symptoms, diagnosis and possible drugs we might stumble upon valuable information sometimes. At times, we can point out our preferences among the various treatment options. Occasionally, we can pose intelligent queries. And sometimes, our unique knowledge might result in a significant discovery previously unknown to the doctor. (And just like investing, occasionally our limited knowledge can be detrimental to our health if we disregard the expert's advice.)\n",

      "Paraphrased Response:  A justifiable rationale for cancelling credit cards could be: The card carries an annual fee that's unnecessary for you. It's not worth having your money drained yearly. Another reason is to churn rewards. This involves opening a card to avail of a bonus offer such as \"earn $200 bonus by spending $500 in the initial 3 months\". You can then close the card and reapply after a year to recreate the same bonus, given it's still available. However, bear in mind, numerous cards prevent such actions. A third reason is to accommodate new cards from the same provider. For instance, if you have five cards from Chase and intend to apply for a sixth, but Chase argues you have reached your credit limit, you can cancel one of your cards to acquire the new one. Moreover, I have observed that numerous banks permit credit transfer from your existing card to the new one rather than having to cancel them.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The points given by DumbCoder are very valid. Diversifying portfolio is always a good idea. Including Metals is also a good idea. Investing in single metal though may not be a good idea.   •Silver is pretty cheap now, hopefully it will be for a while. •Silver is undervalued compared to gold. World reserve ratio is around 1 to 11, while price is around 1 to 60. Both the above are iffy statements. Cheap is relative term ... there are quite a few metals more cheaper than Silver [Copper for example]. Undervalued doesn't make sense. Its a quesiton of demand and supply. Today Industrial use of Silver is more widespread, and its predecting future what would happen. If you are saying Silver will appreciate more than other metals, it again depends on country and time period. There are times when even metals like Copper have given more returns than Silver and Gold. There is also Platinum to consider. In my opinion quite a bit of stuff is put in undervalued ... i.e. comparing reserve ratio to price in absolute isn't right comparing it over relative years is right. What the ratio says is for every 11 gms of silver, there is 1 gm of Gold and the price of this 1 gm is 60 times more than silver. True. And nobody tell is the demand of Silver 60 times more than Gold or 11 times more than Gold. i.e. the consumption. What is also not told is the cost to extract the 11 gms of silver is less than cost of 1 gm of Gold. So the cheapness you are thinking is  not 100% true.\n",

      "•Silver seems to be underpriced when compared to Gold. The world reserve ratio approximates to 1 to 11, while the price ratio teeters around 1 to 60. However, both of these claims are open to debate. Terms such as 'cheap' are relative... there are numerous metals that are less expensive than Silver [like Copper, for instance]. The concept of being 'undervalued' seems ambiguous as it's subjected to demand and supply dynamics. Silver is being used extensively in various industries today, and predicting its future value can be uncertain. Insisting that the value of Silver will rise more than other metals, is largely contingent on time frames and geographical factors. There have been instances when even Copper offered higher returns than Silver and Gold. Platinum is another viable option in this context. \n",

      "In conclusion, calling something 'undervalued' i.e., juxtaposing reserve ratio with price outrightly, isn't entirely accurate- it should be compared over a multitude of years. According to the ratio, every 11 gms of Silver corresponds to 1 gm of Gold, and this quantity of Gold is priced 60 times higher than Silver, which is indeed correct. However, what isn't very clear is if the demand for Silver exceeds that of Gold by 60 or 11 times, accounting for consumption. It's also overlooked that the cost of mining 11 gms of Silver is less than that of 1 gm of Gold. Therefore, the apparent 'cheapness' isn't entirely accurate.\n",

If you owned a restaurant that made a profit for 45 years and then went bankrupt you are fine, you took your profits every year because why on earth would you reinvest 100% of the profit forever? But what if you could sell 49.9% of that restaurant on the stock market, get all of that IPO money and still keep all of the profits while claiming that you reinvest it forever? That's exactly what they do! They just buy expensive things for personal use, from fancy cars to private jets, they just write it down as an investment and you can't see what the money was spent on because you are not a majority stakeholder, you have no power. It was not like this forever, companies used to pay all of their profits in dividends and be valued according to that. Not anymore. Now they are just in it for the growth, it will keep growing as long as people keep buying into it, and that's the exact definition of a Ponzi scheme.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Indeed, without any profit distribution in the form of dividends, it would resemble a Ponzi setup. Here's my reasoning: The present generation, namely millenials, aren't saving as much as they're splurging. This denotes a shift in mindset. If this pattern persists, a time will come when spenders outnumber savers. This scenario, extrapolated to two decades later, would indicate that despite a company potentially earning and selling more, due to a reduction in market investors, its value can decrease (basic economics of supply and demand supports this hypothesis). Isn't that a glaring inconsistency in your opinions? Doesn't it stipulate that any profits generated are not exactly yours, rather you are idly speculating about these profits? Hypothetically, if I retain ownership of a company from its IPO and witness its value increase over 50 years, and even if it managed to be enormously profitable for 45 of those years without distributing a penny in dividends, and eventually ceases to exist after 5 more years, what becomes of all the profits acquired over the 45-year period? If one owned a restaurant, which was profitable for 45 years before going bankrupt, one would have withdrawn profits yearly instead of continuously reinvesting all of it, wouldn't they? But, consider selling 49.9% of that restaurant's stocks, pocketing the IPO funds and still retain the profits under the pretext of ongoing reinvestment, isn't that precisely the modus operandi? They continue to splurge on luxuries ranging from exotic cars to private jet skis, camouflaging it as an investment which you are powerless to scrutinize, given your minority stakes in the company. It hasn't always been like this - companies traditionally paid out all their profits through dividends and were valued accordingly. Presently, they are mere growth chasers who will continue to grow as long as people keep investing, and that's exactly a Ponzi scheme by definition.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Am I required to send form 1099 to non-US citizens who are not even residing in the US? Since they're not required to file US taxes, do I still have to send the form to them? That's tricky. You need to get W8/W9 from them, and act accordingly. You may need to withhold 30% (or different percentage, depending on tax treaty they claim on W8). If you withhold taxes, you also need to file form 1042. I suggest you talk to a tax professional. Is it fine to expose my ITIN (taxpayer identification number) to   individuals or companies who I send the form to them. Since the form   requires me to write my TIN/EIN, what would be the risks of this and   what precautions should be taken to avoid inappropriate/illegal use? No, it is not OK. But if you pay these people directly - you don't have much choice, so deal with it. Get a good insurance for identity theft, and don't transact with people you don't trust. One alternative would be to pay through a payment processor (Paypal or credit cards) - see your next question. I send payments via PayPal and wire transfer. Should I send form   1099-MISC or 1099-K? Paypal is a corporation, so you don't need to send 1099 to Paypal. Whatever Paypal sends to others - it will issue the appropriate forms. Similarly if you use a credit card for payment. When you send money through Paypal - you don't send money directly to your business counterparts. You send money to Paypal.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Is it necessary for me to send a 1099 form to non-U.S. citizens who don't even live in America? Since they're not obligated to pay U.S. taxes, is the form still needed? It’s complicated. You must collect from them a W8/W9 form and act accordingly. There might be a need to retain 30% (or a varying amount, based on the tax treaty claimed on their W8 form). If you do withhold taxes, you’re also responsible for submitting a 1042 form. It would be a good idea to consult a tax specialist. Is it acceptable to reveal my ITIN (personal tax ID number) to the individuals or businesses I'm giving the form to? Given that the form demands my TIN/EIN, what risks could this present and what steps can be taken to prevent misuse or illicit activity? No, it isn't advisable, but if you're the one making these payments directly, there isn't much of an option. Protect yourself with identity theft insurance and avoid transactions with individuals you're skeptical of. One possibility could be to utilize a payment processor like Paypal or credit cards (which brings us to your next question). I process payments through PayPal and wire transfers. Is it the 1099-MISC or 1099-K form I should send? Paypal is a corporation, thus there's no need for them to receive a 1099. They will issue the appropriate forms for any payments they send out.

      "Reference Response:  What is your biggest wealth building tool?  Income.  If you \"nerf\" your income with payments to banks, cable, credit card debt, car payments, and lattes then you are naturally handicapping your wealth building.  It is sort of like trying to drive home a nail holding a hammer right underneath the head.   Normal is broke, don't be normal. Normal obtains student loans while getting an education.  You don't have to.  You can work part time, or even full time and get a degree. As an example, here is one way to do it in Florida.  Get a job working fast food and get your associates degree using a community college that are cheap.  Then apply for the state troopers.  Go away for about 5 months, earning an income the whole time.  You automatically graduate with a job that pays for state schools.  Take the next three years (or more if you want an advanced degree) to get your bachelors.  Then start your desirable career. What is better to have \"wasted\" approx 1.5 years being a state trooper, or to have a student loan payment for 20 years?  There is not even pressure to obtain employment right after graduation.  BTW, I know someone who is doing exactly what I outlined. Every commercial you watch is geared toward getting you to sign on the line that is dotted, often going into debt to do so.  Car commercials will tell you that you are a bad mom or not a real man if you don't drive the 2015 whatever.   Think differently, throw out your numbers and shoot for zero debt. EDIT:  OP, I have a MS in Comp Sci, and started one in finance.  My wife also has a masters.  We had debt.  We paid that crap off.  Work like a fiend and do the same.  My wife's was significant.  She planned on having her employer pay it off for each year she worked there.  (Like 20% each year or something.)  Guess what, that did not work out!  She went to work somewhere else!  Live like you are still in college and use all that extra money to get rid of your debt.  Student loans are consumer debt.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  What's your most vital tool for building wealth? Your earnings. If you constantly diminish your income with numerous outgoing payments, such as bank charges, cable bills, credit card debts, automobile repayments, and unnecessary luxury purchases, you're unwittingly impairing your wealth growth. This is similar to attempting to drive a nail while gripping the hammer just below the head. Being financially strapped is typical, but don't conform to this. The norm is having student loans throughout education, but it's not a necessity. Think of working part- or full-time while pursuing a degree. Here's a Florida-based example: You can take up a fast food job and earn an associates degree at an affordable community college. You then become a state trooper, earn for around 5 months, and automatically secure a job that pays for state-run colleges. Spend the next three or more years to finish your bachelors, then kick-start your desired profession. Would you rather trade a year and a half in a state trooper's role or bear a 20-year student loan? You don't even have to stress about finding a job instantly post-graduation. For the record, I personally know someone following this exact path. Remember that every ad you encounter aims to tempt you into signing agreements, often pushing you into debt. Car ads might guilt you into believing that you're not a good parent or a capable individual if you don't own the most recent model. Break free from conventional thinking, redo your number crunching and aim for a debt-free life. An aside: I hold a Masters in Computer Science and partially completed a finance degree. Similarly, my wife holds a masters. We had loans, but we worked hard and cleared it all. Emulate that effort. Her loan value was quite big, and the plan was to have her job cover the loan partially every year. Things didn't fall into place, she switched her job! Maintain your collegiate lifestyle and use your excess income to clear your debts. View student loans as consumer debts.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Specific stock advice isn't permitted on these boards. I'm discussing the process of a call spread with the Apple Jan 13 calls as an example.  In effect, you have $10 to 'bet.' Each bet you'd construct offers a different return (odds). For example, If you bought the $750 call at $37.25, you'd need to look to find what strike has a bid of $27 or higher. The $790 is bid $27.75. So this particular spread is a 4 to 1 bet the stock will close in January over $790, with a $760 break even.  You can pull the number from Yahoo to a spreadsheet to make your own chart of spread costs, but I'll give one more example.  You think it will go over $850, and that strike is now ask $18.85. The highest strike currently listed is $930, and it's bid $10.35. So this spread cost is $850, and a close over $930 returns $8000 or over 9 to 1.  Again, this is not advice, just an analysis of how spreads work. Note, any anomalies in the pricing above is the effect of a particular strike having no trades today, not every strike is active so 'last trade' can be days old.   Note: My answer adds to AlexR's response in that once you used the word bet and showed a desire to make a risky move, options are the answer. You acknowledged you understand the basic concept, but given the contract size of 100 shares, these suggestions are ways to bet under your $1000 limit and profit from the gain in the underlying stock you hope to see.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  These forums do not allow specific stock recommendations. I'm merely illustrating how a call spread operates, using Apple Jan 13 calls as an example. Essentially, you have $10 to 'wager.' The potential returns vary depending on how you arrange every wager. For instance, if you purchase the $750 call for $37.25, you would need to determine what strike is bidding at or above $27. The $790 strike is bidding $27.75, making this particular spread a 4:1 wager that the stock price will exceed $790 by January, with a break even at $760. You can use numbers from Yahoo and input them into a spreadsheet to chart spread costs for your own reference, but I’ll share another example. If you anticipate the stock surpassing $850, that strike is currently asking $18.85. The highest existing strike is $930, with a bid of $10.35. This implies that the spread cost is $850, and if it closes above $930, the return would be $8000, or a ratio of over 9 to 1. Remember, this isn't advice, just an examination of how spreads operate. Be aware that pricing discrepancies may be due to no trading activity for a specific strike today. Not all strikes are active daily so the 'last trade' may be days old. In addition to AlexR’s answer regarding options being the solution when you expressed using the term 'bet' and demonstrating a willingness to take risks, I’m suggesting another approach. Though you grasp the fundamentals, considering the large contract size of 100 shares, these suggestions provide ways to wager below your $1000 cap and benefit from the stock’s anticipated increase.\n",

      "Reference Response:  A checking account is one that permits the account holder to write demand drafts (checks), which can be given to other people as payment and processed by the banks to transfer those funds. (Think of a check as a non-electronic equivalent of a debit card transaction, if that makes more sense to you.) Outside of the ability to write checks, and the slightly lower interest rate usually offered to trade off against that convenience, there really is no significant difference between savings and checking accounts.  The software needs to be designed to handle checking accounts if it's to be sold in the US, since many of us do still use checks for some transactions. Adding support for other currencies doesn't change that. If you don't need the ability to track which checks have or haven't been fully processed, I'd suggest that you either simply ignore the checking account feature, or use this category separation in whatever manner makes sense for the way you want to manage your money.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  A checking account authorizes the holder to pen demand drafts, also known as checks, which can be issued to others as a form of payment and the banks then handle the fund transfer process. Consider a check as non-digital parallel to a debit card transaction if that gives you a clearer understanding. Apart from the provision of writing checks, and the relatively lower interest rate typically provided as a trade-off for this facility, there isn't a tremendous distinction between savings and checking accounts. If the software is aimed for the US market, it has to incorporate handling checking accounts, given that quite a few Americans still employ checks for certain transactions. The addition of support for foreign currencies has no impact on this. Unless you require to keep a record of which checks are processed or not, I would advise that you either disregard the checking account functionality, or utilize this category differentiation in a manner that fits your financial management approach.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I can't speak authoritatively to your broader question about stocks in general, but in several years tracking AAPL closely, I can tell you that there's little apparent pattern to when their earnings call will be, or when it will be announced. What little I do know:  - AAPL's calls tend to occur on a Tuesday more than any other day of the week  - it's announced roughly a month in advance, but has been announced w/ less notice  - it has a definite range of dates in which it occurs, typically somewhere in the 3rd week of the new quarter plus or minus a few days More broadly for #1: Given the underlying nature of what an option is, then yes, the day an earnings call date is announced could certainly influence the IV/price of options - but only for options that expire inside the \"grey area\" (~2 weeks long) window in which the call could potentially occur.  Options expiring outside that grey area should experience little to no price change in reaction to the announcement of the date - unless the date was itself surprising, e.g. an earlier date would increase the premium on earlier dated options, a later date would increase the premium for later-dated options. As for #2: The exact date will probably always be a mystery, but the main factors are:  - the historical pattern of earnings call dates (and announcements of those dates) which you can look up for any given company  - when the company's quarter ends  - potentially some influence in how long it takes the company to close out their books for the quarter (some types of businesses would be faster than others)  - any special considerations for this particular quarter that affect reporting ability And finally:   - a surprise of an earnings call occurring (substantively) later than usual is rarely going to be a good sign for the underlying security, and the expectation of catastrophe - while cratering the underlying - may also cause a disproportionate rise in IVs/prices due to fear\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  While I'm not in a position to provide a definitive answer about the greater scope of the stock market, I can share my personal observations regarding AAPL. In the years I've been closely monitoring AAPL, it's been difficult to discern a clear pattern in the announcement or actual timing of their earnings call. To share a bit of what I do know:\n",
      "\n",
      " - More often than not, AAPL's calls are scheduled on a Tuesday.\n",
      " - The announcement of the call is usually made roughly a month beforehand, albeit sometimes, it is done with shorter notice.\n",
      " - The call usually occurs in a specific timeframe, usually within the third week of the new quarter plus or minus a couple of days.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address your first question more generally, the announcement of the earnings call date has the potential to impact the implied volatility/price of the options, but this primarily affects options that expire within the uncertain period (~2-weeks) around the possible call date. Options that expire outside this grey zone are unlikely to experience significant price fluctuations upon the announcement, unless the date is unexpectedly altered. In such cases, an earlier or later date can respectively increase the premium on related options.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to your second query, the exact date will always remain uncertain. However, primary factors like the company's historical pattern of earnings call dates, the end of the company's quarter, the time needed by the company to finalize their quarterly accounts, and any unique considerations for that particular quarter affecting reporting ability can provide some insight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, an unexpected delay in the earnings call is generally not considered a positive indicator for the underlying security, and the anticipation of a potential disaster, though causing a decrease in the underlying security, may prompt an abrupt increase in implied volatilities/prices due to increased fear.\n",

      "Reference Response:  You must understand that not everyone has or can get credit cards. Consider that those who are in the the lowest 20-30% of income tend to have fewer credit cards (or none), and lower credit debt, although some have quite high credit card debt relative to their income.  So you really aren't comparing the same demographics (the population of all income earners, used to calculate average income, and the population of all credit card debt holders, are not the same groups of people). Once you remove those folks from consideration, then credit card usage may still average higher, but accept that it is unusual for people making less than $20K-30K/year to have much credit card debt. You must understand that wealth and income are two very different (although related) concepts. One must note that there are millions of people in the U.S. who have wealth; they have net assets of over $1M (excluding their homes). Many of those folks have assets greatly exceeding $1M. And although it might seem foolish to carry a large balance on their credit cards, they may have quite low interest rates, and simply find it simpler and more convenient to use credit cards in lieu of personal loans.  Suppose you have $2M in net assets, and want to buy a classic car or a diamond necklace.  Charging $30K and carrying the balance until a dividend check arrives may make sense. Understand also that not everyone makes the same choices, or good choices. Carrying a credit card balance may appear like a poor choice, especially when you are not wealthy, or have lower income. But suppose you have a high credit limit across several cards, and you need to handle a short-term financial challenge (car repair, layoff, medical bills, etc).  You might use the credit card to pay for that purchase, essentially financing an extraordinary event over a longer period of time.  And although having a balance of more than 5-10% of your monthly income may seem foolish to some, it may make sense to others. And some people choose to carry balances of 50% to 100% of their credit limit.  Others realize that keeping their credit utilization below 30%, 20%, or 10% of the credit limit is a better plan (both interest rate and risk wise).\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  It's important to grasp that not every individual possesses or is capable of obtaining credit cards. Keep in mind that those in the bottom 20-30% of income typically have fewer (or no) credit cards and lower credit debt, although some may have hefty credit card debt compared to their earnings. Hence, you're not really comparing like-for-like groups - the populations of all income earners (employed to calculate average income) and all credit card debt owners aren't identical. Once we exclude these people from our considerations, the average use of credit cards might still be high, but it's not common for those earning less than $20K-30K annually to accumulate substantial credit card debt. It's critical to differentiate between wealth and income, even though they're connected. Take into consideration that millions of U.S. citizens are wealthy and their net assets exceed $1M, excluding their residences. It may appear irrational for these individuals to maintain high balances on their credit cards, but they could be benefiting from low interest rates and find it easier and more practical to rely on credit cards instead of personal loans. For example, if you have $2M in net assets and want to purchase an expensive car or diamond necklace, charging $30K and postponing payment until a dividend check is received could be a reasonable option. Also, bear in mind that not everybody makes identical or wise decisions. Having credit card debt can seem like an ill-advised decision, particularly for those who aren't wealthy or have a lower income. However, if you have a high credit capacity across multiple cards and need to manage an unexpected financial hurdle (like vehicle maintenance, job loss, healthcare bills, etc.), you might decide to use the credit card to fund that expenditure, effectively distributing the cost of an unusual situation over a longer timeframe. Having a balance exceeding 5-10% of your monthly salary might seem reckless to some, but others might see it as logical. There are people who decide to maintain balances equating to 50% to 100% of their credit capacity, while others think maintaining their credit usage under 30%, 20%, or 10% of the credit capacity is a smarter move (both in terms of interest rates and risks).\n",

      "Reference Response:  Emergency funds have a very specific and obvious benefit; you'll have money sitting around in case you need it.  A lot of people think a big car repair or some unexpected home repair is an emergency, and that's fine.  Emergency also expands up to \"I lost my job four months ago and we're a year in to a recession, the stock market is down 30% and I need to pay my rent or mortgage.\"  Sure, you could just sell some of your stocks that have lost 30% and pay your rent. I know nobody likes to think about it, but the stock market can go down.  I know nobody likes to think about it, but the economy can slink in to a recession.  In fact, here's a small list of recent U.S. recessions: No competent investment adviser would advise that your emergency funds should be subject to market volatility because that completely defeats the purpose of an emergency fund. It's possible that this manager wants you to indicate a separate emergency fund to allocate a portion of your account to a low volatility US Treasury fund or something of the like, this would be materially different than investing in a broad market/large cap fund like VOO or VTI.  The effects of inflation are not so bad that you should put your emergency money in the market.  Who cares what inflation was if you have to sell an asset at a loss to pay rent?  One last point.  Index fund ETFs are not \"safe.\"  Investing in diversified funds is safER than buying individual company stocks.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The main advantage of an emergency fund is clear and straightforward; it ensures that you have money on hand when you need it. Many individuals perceive a hefty car maintenance bill or sudden home repair as an emergency, and that's acceptable. The concept of an emergency also extends to situations like \"I have been unemployed for four months, we are a year deep into a recession, the stock market has plummeted 30%, and I need to cover my housing cost.\" Indeed, one option could be to sell some of your stocks that have depreciated by 30% to pay your rent. I understand it's an unpleasant thought, but the reality is the stock market can tumble. Similarly, the economy can slip into a recession. As an instance, here's a brief rundown of recent U.S. recessions: The general consensus among proficient investment advisors is that your emergency funds should be insulated from market volatility, as this defeats the principle of an emergency fund. Perhaps, your manager is encouraging you to earmark a distinctive emergency fund toward investing a segment of your account in a stable US Treasury fund or something similar, which is quite distinct from investing in a comprehensive market/large cap fund such as VOO or VTI. The impact of inflation is not detrimental enough to justify investing your emergency funds in the market. Does inflation really matter if you're forced to sell an asset at a loss to afford rent?

      "Reference Response:  A mortgage lender will not usually lend more than they could get if they had to repossess the property and sell it to recover their investment (in the U.S. it is generally accepted that 80% of market value is the golden number that makes the mortgage work).  That's why an appraisal is required. Even with 50% down, the numbers might not add up if your property is appraised very low (extremely unlikely, though. It's more likely your realtor is inexperienced).\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Typically, a mortgage lender refrains from loaning an amount exceeding what they might fetch if they were compelled to seize and sell the property to recoup their investment. In the United States, it's generally agreed that 80% of the market value makes the mortgage feasible. This necessity prompts the requirement for an appraisal. Even if you put down 50%, the financial math may not compute if your property is assessed exceedingly low, although this is a highly unlikely scenario. It's more probable that your real estate agent lacks experience.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Remember that due to inflation you are paying back the loan with cheaper dollars in the future.  If there are no gimmicks in the loan like early payment penalties, or must pay by a certain date or that the credit was for a store that sold the products at a higher price than you could get elsewhere then you are not just getting free money they are paying you to take the money.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Keep in mind, considering inflation, you're essentially repaying the loan with less valuable dollars in the future. Provided the loan doesn't have any tricky conditions, such as penalties for early repayment, mandatory pay-by dates, or was used at a store that overpriced its merchandise, it's not as simple as you receiving free money. In actuality, they are compensating you to accept the cash.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I'm the contrarian in the crowd. I think credit scores and debt are the closest thing to evil incarnate. You're in good company. The absence of a credit score simply means the agencies have insufficient data in their behavioral model to determine how profitable your business would be to the bank. The higher your score, the more likely the bank is to make a profit from your loan.  IMHO, you're better off building up cash and investment reserves than a credit history. With sufficient reserves,  you will be able to shop around for a bank that will give you a good rate, if you ever do need a loan.  You'll be surprised at how quickly you get in a position where you don't need a loan if you save and invest wisely. I used to have a (high) credit score,  and I was miserable about it because there were always bills due. I gave up debt 14 years ago, paid the last debt 7 years ago, and have never. been happier. Raising kids without debt (or credit score) is much more fun than with debt.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In the crowd, I tend to oppose the popular opinion. In my view, credit scores and debt are nearly synonymous with malevolence. You're not alone in this. A lack of a credit score simply implies that credit agencies don't have enough data points in their model to predict your business's profitability to the bank. The more significant your score, the higher the bank's chances of profiting from your loan. In my personal opinion, it's more beneficial to focus on growing your liquid assets and investments rather than a credit history. By accumulating enough reserves, you'll be in a position to negotiate with banks for favourable interest rates, if you ever require a loan. You'd be amazed at how soon you reach a point of not needing a loan if you save and invest prudently. I once had a substantial credit score and it made me miserable with its incessant bills. I renounced debt 14 years back, paid off the last of it 7 years ago, and have never been more content. Personally, I've found it more enjoyable to raise children without the burden of debt or a credit score.\n",

      "Reference Response:  One other consideration is that by paying off your mortgage early versus, for example, investing that capital in a mutual fund is that you are reducing your net liquidity to some degree. That is, if you find yourself needing an emergency infusion of cash it is easier to sell a stock/fund than to sell your house or get a equity loan.  I suppose if you were planning to need a lot of cash to start a business or invest in real estate, then maybe it would make sense to keep your cash more liquid. However, in your situation I agree with Joe. Pay it off. It feels REALLY good to write that last check!\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  One factor to think about is that putting your money into clearing your mortgage sooner, in comparison to investing it in a mutual fund, diminishes your net liquidity to an extent. Meaning, if you find yourself in dire need of cash, selling a stock or fund is more straightforward than trying to sell your house or apply for an equity loan. Supposing you anticipate needing a substantial amount of money for purposes like starting a business or investing in properties, maintaining more liquidated assets might be the wise choice.

Since you haven't been only your own policy lately, it will cost you more than someone with a 3 year history with a perfect record, but if you shop around, you will find something at a fair price.

      "Reference Response:  Sure! Anything that affects the balance of supply and demand could cause rent prices to fall. I'll betcha rent prices in Wilmington, Ohio collapsed when the biggest employer, DHL, shut down. An economic depression of any sort would cause people to substitute expensive rentals for cheaper ones, putting downward pressure on rents. It would also cause people to double up or move in with family, decreasing demand for rentals. Anything that makes buying a house cheaper will actually make rents lower, too, because more people will buy houses when houses get cheaper... those people are moving out of rentals, thus decreasing demand for rentals.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Absolutely! Any factors impacting supply and demand dynamics could drive down rental costs. Just take, for example, the housing market in Wilmington, Ohio, where rental prices probably took a hit when the largest employer, DHL, closed its doors. Any form of economic downturn could make tenants opt for more affordable accommodations, thus exerting downward trends on rental prices. It could also motivate individuals to share accommodations or live with relatives, lessening the need for rented places. Moreover, anything that lowers the costs of homeownership could also result in decreased rental prices, as more individuals would opt for buying homes when they become more affordable. This process would mean fewer people needing rented accommodation, thus reducing the demand for rentals.\n",

      "Reference Response:  They don't have to take cash if they reasonably told you in advance they don't take cash, because they made fair effort to prevent you from incurring a debt.  They don't have to take cash if the transaction hasn't yet happened (not a debt) or if it can be easily undone at no cost to either party - such as a newspaper subscription they can just stop delivering.  Both of these reasons are limited by the rules against discrimination, see below.  They don't have to take cash if it's impracticable. For instance a transit bus when fares first went to $1.00, it took years to fund new fareboxes able to take paper money.  You don't have to take a mortgage payment in pennies.  Liquor stores don't have to take $100 bills. (it requires them to keep too much change in the till, which makes them a robbery target).  Trouble arises when it appears there's an ulterior motive for the rule.   Suppose a Landlord Jim requires rent to be paid with EFT.  Rent-controlled Marcie tells the judge \"It's a scheme to oust me, he knows I'm unbanked\".  Jim counters \"No. I got mugged last month because criminals know when I collect cash rents.\"  It will turn on whether Jim can show good-faith effort to work with his unbanked tenants to find other ways to pay. If Jim does a particularly bad job of this, he could find himself paying Marcie's legal bills! Even worse if the ulterior motive is discrimination. Chet the plumber hates Muslims. Alice the feed supplier hates the Amish.  So they decide to take credit cards only, knowing those people's religions don't allow them.  Their goose is cooked once they can't show any other reasonable reason to refuse cash.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  If a business has adequately informed you beforehand that it doesn't accept cash, it's not obliged to accept such payments, as they've taken appropriate measures to hamper you from accumulating a debt. This also applies to transactions that have not been initiated (no debt incurred) or can be effortlessly reversed without expense to any of the parties involved - think of a newspaper company simply halting delivery. However, these actions are controlled by anti-discrimination laws mentioned later. Accepting cash can be deemed unmanageable in certain scenarios, like when bus facilities needed several years to upgrade their fare boxes to accept dollar bills after fares increased to $1.00. Similarly, it's unreasonable to force acceptance of mortgage payments in pennies or compel liquor stores to accept $100 bills, which would necessitate safekeeping large quantities of change, increasing the threat of burglary. Trouble launches when there appears to be an underlying agenda for the rule.\n",

      "Consider a situation in which Landlord Jim insists on Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) as the sole payment method for rent. Tenant Marcie, living in a rent-controlled apartment, alleges to the judge, \"It's a trick to oust me, knowing I don't have access to banking services\". Jim rebuts, \"I was robbed last month because criminals knew when I collect cash rents.\" The case will hinge on whether Jim displayed a sincere effort to assist tenants without bank access in finding alternative payment methods. If Jim handles this poorly, he could end up footing Marcie's legal costs! It becomes significantly more severe if there's underlying discrimination involved.\n",

      "Reference Response:  First, a clarification. No assets are immune to inflation, apart from inflation-indexed securities like TIPS or inflation-indexed gilts (well, if held to maturity, these are at least close). Inflation causes a decline in the future purchasing power of a given dollar1 amount, and it certainly doesn't just affect government bonds, either. Regardless of whether you hold equity, bonds, derivatives, etc., the real value of those assets is declining because of inflation, all else being equal. For example, if I invest $100 in an asset that pays a 10% rate of return over the next year, and I sell my entire position at the end of the year, I have $110 in nominal terms. Inflation affects the real value of this asset regardless of its asset class because those $110 aren't worth as much in a year as they are today, assuming inflation is positive. An easy way to incorporate inflation into your calculations of rate of return is to simply subtract the rate of inflation from your rate of return. Using the previous example with inflation of 3%, you could estimate that although the nominal value of your investment at the end of one year is $110, the real value is $100*(1 + 10% - 3%) = $107. In other words, you only gained $7 of purchasing power, even though you gained $10 in nominal terms. This back-of-the-envelope calculation works for securities that don't pay fixed returns as well. Consider an example retirement portfolio. Say I make a one-time investment of $50,000 today in a portfolio that pays, on average, 8% annually. I plan to retire in 30 years, without making any further contributions (yes, this is an over-simplified example). I calculate that my portfolio will have a value of 50000 * (1 + 0.08)^30, or $503,132. That looks like a nice amount, but how much is it really worth? I don't care how many dollars I have; I care about what I can buy with those dollars.  If I use the same rough estimate of the effect of inflation and use a 8% - 3% = 5% rate of return instead, I get an estimate of what I'll have at retirement, in today's dollars. That allows me to make an easy comparison to my current standard of living, and see if my portfolio is up to scratch. Repeating the calculation with 5% instead of 8% yields 50000 * (1 + 0.05)^30, or $21,6097. As you can see, the amount is significantly different. If I'm accustomed to living off $50,000 a year now, my calculation that doesn't take inflation into account tells me that I'll have over 10 years of living expenses at retirement. The new calculation tells me I'll only have a little over 4 years. Now that I've clarified the basics of inflation, I'll respond to the rest of the answer.  I want to know if I need to be making sure my investments span multiple currencies to protect against a single country's currency failing. As others have pointed out, currency doesn't inflate; prices denominated in that currency inflate. Also, a currency failing is significantly different from a prices denominated in a currency inflating. If you're worried about prices inflating and decreasing the purchasing power of your dollars (which usually occurs in modern economies) then it's a good idea to look for investments and asset allocations that, over time, have outpaced the rate of inflation and that even with the effects of inflation, still give you a high enough rate of return to meet your investment goals in real, inflation-adjusted terms. If you have legitimate reason to worry about your currency failing, perhaps because your country doesn't maintain stable monetary or fiscal policies, there are a few things you can do. First, define what you mean by \"failing.\" Do you mean ceasing to exist, or simply falling in unit purchasing power because of inflation? If it's the latter, see the previous paragraph. If the former, investing in other currencies abroad may be a good idea. Questions about currencies actually failing are quite general, however, and (in my opinion) require significant economic analysis before deciding on a course of action/hedging. I would ask the same question about my home's value against an inflated currency as well. Would it keep the same real value. Your home may or may not keep the same real value over time. In some time periods, average home prices have risen at rates significantly higher than the rate of inflation, in which case on paper, their real value has increased. However, if you need to make substantial investments in your home to keep its price rising at the same rate as inflation, you may actually be losing money because your total investment is higher than what you paid for the house initially. Of course, if you own your home and don't have plans to move, you may not be concerned if its value isn't keeping up with inflation at all times. You're deriving additional satisfaction/utility from it, mainly because it's a place for you to live, and you spend money maintaining it in order to maintain your physical standard of living, not just its price at some future sale date. 1) I use dollars as an example. This applies to all currencies.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  To begin with, let's clarify. There isn't any type of asset that is impervious to inflation except ones that are indexed to it, such as TIPS or inflation-indexed gilts (provided they are held until maturity, at least to some extent). The fall in the future buying capacity of a fixed amount in dollars is a result of inflation, and it certainly doesn't just have an impact on government bonds. Whether you possess equities, bonds, derivatives, or the like, their actual worth diminishes due to inflation, assuming all other factors are equal. For instance, if I put $100 in an asset that provides a 10% yield over the upcoming year and sell it entirely at the end of that year, I would have $110 nominally. Nevertheless, inflation impacts the actual worth of this asset, independent of its class, as the $110 would be less valuable in a year, assuming inflation is prevalent. One simple method to incorporate inflation into your yield calculations is by subtracting inflation rate from your yield rate. Using the previous scenario with an inflation rate of 3%, you might guess that despite the nominal value of your investment ending up at $110 after a year, its actual value would be $100*(1 + 10% - 3%) = $107. Hence, your purchasing power increase is only $7, even though you gained $10 nominally. This rough calculation can apply to securities without fixed returns too. Let's consider a hypothetical retirement investment portfolio. Suppose I make a one-off investment of $50,000 presently in a portfolio that pays, on average, 8% per annum. I intend to retire in 30 years, without adding any more money (Yes, this is an overly simplified model). I estimate that my portfolio will be valued at 50000 * (1 + 0.08)^30, or $503,132. It seems like a substantial sum, but what is it's actual worth? I'm concerned about what my dollars can buy, not the number of dollars. If I apply the same approximate estimate of inflation's influence and use a rate of 8% - 3% = 5% return instead, I can estimate my retirement wealth in today's money. This allows me to seamlessly compare this with my current lifestyle to see if my portfolio is sufficient. Substituting 8% with 5% in my calculation results in 50000 * (1 + 0.05)^30, or $21,6097. Clearly, this figure is considerably lower. If I'm currently used to a yearly expenditure of $50,000, my inflation-ignorant calculation suggests I’ll have beyond 10 years of living expenses in my retirement. However, the revised calculation states I'll only have a bit over 4 years' worth. Now that the fundamentals of inflation have been clarified, I'll respond to the rest of the query. Does there need to be a spread out of my investments across several currencies as safety against the failure of a single country's currency? There's been talk that currency itself does not inflate; it's the prices denominated in that currency that inflate. Besides, inflation in prices denominated in a currency is far different from the currency in question collapsing. For those concerned about inflating prices and the subsequent depreciation of their dollars' buying power (which is generally the case in today's economies), it would be wise to seek out investments and asset allocations which have, historically, risen above the inflation rate and that despite the effects of inflation, still yield a satisfactory rate of return sufficient to meet your investment objectives in real terms, accounting for inflation. For those who are genuinely concerned about their currency crashing, possibly due to instability in their country's monetary or fiscal policies, there are a few steps to be taken. Firstly, clarify what \"failing\" means to you. Is it about the currency vanishing or just the depreciation of single-unit buying power due to inflation? If it's the latter, refer to the previous paragraph. If it's the former, it might be beneficial to invest in foreign currencies. Queries concerning absolute collapse of currency are rather broad and, in my opinion, need substantial economic study prior to deciding on a strategy or a hedge. Similar questions can be asked concerning the real value of my home against an inflated currency. A home may or may not preserve its actual value over time. During certain periods, average house prices have surged at rates considerably higher than inflation rates, hence in theory their actual value has escalated. However, if significant investments need to be made on your home to keep its price in line with inflation, you might be losing money as your total investment surpasses the original cost of the house. Nonetheless, if you own your home and do not intend to relocate, declining in value with inflation may not be a concern since it serves as your shelter and you spend money to keep it up for maintaining your living standards, and not just for future sale prices. 1) This example uses dollars as currency but is applicable to all currencies.\n",

      "Reference Response:  For simplicity, let's start by just considering cash back. In general, cash back from credit cards for personal use is not taxable, but for business use it is taxable (sort of, I'll explain later). The reason is most personal purchases are made with after tax dollars; you typically aren't deducting the cost of what you purchased from your personal income, so if you purchase something that costs $100 and you receive $2 back from the CC company, effectively you have paid $98 for that item but that wouldn't affect your tax bill. However, since businesses typically deduct most expenses, that same $100 deduction would have only been a $98 deduction for business tax purposes, so in this case the $2 should be accounted for. Note, you should not consider that $2 as income though; that would artificially inflate your revenue. It should be treated as a negative expense, similar to how you would handle returning an item you purchased and receiving a CC refund. Now for your specific questions: Part 1: As a small business owner, I wish to attend an annual seminar to improve my business. I have enough credit card reward points to cover the airfare, hotel, and rental car. Will those expenses still be deductible at the value displayed on the receipt? Effectively no, these expenses are not deductible. If you deduct them they will be completely counter-acted by the \"refund\" you receive for the payments. Part 2: Does it matter if those points are accrued on my personal credit card, rather than a business credit card? This is where it gets hairy. Suppose your company policy is that employees make purchases with their own personal credit cards and submit receipts for reimbursement. In this case the employer can simply reimburse and would not know or care if the employee is racking up rewards/points/cashback. The trick is, as the employee, you must always purchase business related items normally so you have receipts to show, and if you receive cashback on the side there seems to be a \"don't ask, don't tell\" rule that the IRS is OK with. It works the same way with heavy business travelers and airline miles- the free vacations those users get as perks are not treated as taxable income. However, I would not go out of my way to abuse this \"loophole\". Typically, things like travel (airfare, hotel, car rental, meals) are expected. But I wouldn't go purchase 100 company laptops on your personal card and ask the company to reimburse you. The company should purchase those 100 laptops on a company card and effectively reduce the sale price by the cashback received. (Or more realistically, negotiate a better discount with your account rep and just cut them a check.) Part 3: Would there be any difference between credit card points and brand-loyalty points? If the rental car were paid for with points earned directly on the rental car company's loyalty system (not a CC), would that yield a different result? There is no difference. Perhaps the simplest way to think about this is you can only deduct an expense that you actually incur. In other words, the expense should show up on a bank or CC statement. This is why when you volunteer and work 10 hours for a charity, you can't call that a \"donation\" of any amount of money because there is no actual payment made that would show up on a bank statement. Instead you could have billed the charity for your 10 hours of work, and then turned around and donated that same amount back to them, but it ends up being a wash.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Starting with plain cash back, it's generally tax-free when it's from personal use credit cards, but taxable for business use - there are nuances to this, which I'll detail soon. This is due to the fact that most personal acquisitions are bought with post-tax dollars, and typically, you aren't offsetting the purchase price against your individual income. So, if you spend $100 on something and get $2 cash back from the card provider, you pay $98 essentially, but it doesn't reflect on your taxes. However, for businesses, which usually offset most costs, if they deducted $100, it would be a $98 deduction from a tax perspective, so the $2 cash back should be accounted for. But, the $2 shouldn't be considered as income to avoid false increase of revenue. Instead, it should be viewed as a reduction in expenditure, akin to a refund for a returned product. \n",
      "\n",
      "In regards to your specific queries: Part 1: I aim to partake in an annual seminar to boost my venture as a small business owner. I can cover transport, accommodation, and car rental costs using my credit card rewards. Are these expenses still deductible, as their value is shown on the receipt? Unfortunately, these costs aren't deductible, as this would be offset by the \"refund\" you get. \n",
      "\n",
      "Part 2: Does it matter if these points are accumulated on my personal rather than my business card? This is a fuzzy area. Consider this scenario: The company policy dictates that staff members use their personal cards for transactions and provide receipts to receive a reimbursement. The employer wouldn't know or be bothered with the information that the employee receives cash back or gains points/rewards. However, the point to be noted by the employee is this - make outright purchases of business-related goods so that you can showcase the receipts, discretely sidelining any cash backs that is vaguely acceptable to the IRS. The concept applies to frequent fliers, where the complimentary vacation availed isn't considered taxable revenue. Although, this \"grey area\" shouldn’t be exploited. While air travel, hotel, car rentals, and meals are expected, excessive spending such as buying 100 laptops on a personal card and asking for reimbursement would not be suggested. Instead, the company should buy in bulk and adjust the price with the cash back received (preferably, negotiated at a higher discount with the representative and paying through cheque.)\n",

      "Part 3: Is there a difference between points earned through the card versus brand-loyalty points? What if I pay for the car rental through the rental firm's point system?

      "Reference Response:  All great answers. The only thing I didn't see mentioned was that student loans are not dischargable in a bankruptcy. So for example if you took money that could have gone to student loans and poured it into other debt, then for some reason declared bankruptcy later, your student load debt would remain while other debt would be discharged; essentially that money would have been better spent on the student loan. This isn't to advocate that you should pay down student loans with the intent of declaring bankruptcy, or that this makes it a better decision necessarily, just a factor that is sometimes forgotten.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Excellent responses all around. However, one key aspect that wasn't discussed is that student loans can't be wiped out during bankruptcy. To illustrate this, let's say you diverted money you could've put towards your student loans into other forms of debt, and then you were forced to declare bankruptcy. The bankruptcy process would eliminate your other debts, but your student loans would still persist. This implies that the money you used for other debt would've been more effective if used for your student loans. The purpose of mentioning this isn't to insist that you pay off your student loans quickly with the plan to file bankruptcy later, or to claim that this factor makes it a better choice by default, but to just remind you of this often overlooked aspect.\n",

      "Reference Response:  First, check out some of the answers on this question: Oversimplify it for me: the correct order of investing When you have determined that you are ready to invest for retirement, there are two things you need to consider: the investment and the account.  These are separate items. The investment is what makes your money grow. The type of account provides tax advantages (and restrictions).  Generally, these can be considered separately; for the most part, you can do any type of investment in any account. Briefly, here is an overview of some of the main options: In your situation, the Roth IRA is what I would recommend. This grows tax free, and if you need the funds for some reason, you can get out what you put in without penalty. You can invest up to $5500 in your Roth IRA each year. In addition to the above reasons, which are true for anybody, a Roth IRA would be especially beneficial for you for three reasons: For someone that is closer in age to retirement and in a higher tax bracket now, a Roth IRA is less attractive than it is for you. Inside your Roth IRA, there are lots of choices. You can invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds (which are simply collections of stocks and bonds), bank accounts, precious metals, and many other things. Discussing all of these investments in one answer is too broad, but my recommendation is this: If you are investing for retirement, you should be investing in the stock market. However, picking individual stocks is too risky; you need to be diversified in a lot of stocks. Stock mutual funds are a great way to invest in the stock market.  There are lots of different types of stock mutual funds with different strategies and expenses associated with them. Managed funds actively buy and sell different stocks inside them, but have high expenses to pay the managers. Index funds buy and hold a list of stocks, and have very low expenses. The conventional wisdom is that, in general, index funds perform better than managed funds when you take the expenses into account.  I hope this overview and these recommendations were helpful. If you have any specific questions about any of these types of accounts or investments, feel free to ask another question.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Initially, take a look at some responses to this question: \"Breaking it Down: The Correct Sequence of Investing\". When you've decided that you're prepared to invest for your retirement, you need to deliberate on two aspects: the actual investment and the account. These are distinct entities. The investment is the tool that allows your capital to increase. The account type offers tax benefits (and limits). Ordinarily, you can evaluate these separately; in most instances, any type of investment can be done in any account. To give a brief rundown of some key choices: In your case, I would suggest the Roth IRA. This develops tax-free, and if for some reason you need the money, you can draw out what you originally deposited without any penalty. You're allowed to invest up to $5500 in your Roth IRA annually.  Beyond the reasons listed above, a Roth IRA would be particularly advantageous for your situation due to three reasons: A Roth IRA may be less appealing to those closer to retirement age and in higher tax brackets. There's an array of choices within your Roth IRA. You're able to invest in things like stocks, bonds, mutual funds (which are essentially groupings of stocks and bonds), bank accounts, precious metals, among other assets. An all-inclusive discussion of these investments would go beyond the scope of this response, but in short: If your goal is to invest for retirement, investing in stocks should be your primary focus. However, relying only on select stocks can be overly risky; it's crucial to diversify across numerous stocks. Stock mutual funds present an excellent medium to make this happen. Numerous sorts of stock mutual funds exist, each with different strategies and linked expenses. Managed funds tend to actively trade various stocks within themselves, incurring high management costs. Index funds, on the other hand, maintain a stable list of stocks carrying minimal costs. Generally, it is believed that index funds tend to outperform managed funds once expenses are taken into account. My hope is that this overview and the provided suggestions will be of assistance. For any specific inquiries regarding different types of accounts or investments, feel free to raise another query.\n",

      "Reference Response:  How is it possible for the average investor to underperform the market? The \"average\" investor probably makes some bad decisions. You also might need to take transaction costs into play (including borrowing on margin), so that there's a natural \"erosion\" of returns across the market.  Meaning if transaction/borrowing costs are 1%, and the market return is 5%, the \"average investor\"  Alternatively, if by \"average\" they mean the average of the population, not weighted by amount, it's plausible that the mass of smaller investors perform slightly worse than the smaller number of large investors (and have larger relative transaction costs), thus having a lower average on a per-capita basis. Doesn't the fact that investors can consistently underperform the market by making poor decisions, imply that an investor could consistently outperform the market by making the opposite decisions? No.  If my investment decisions cause me to earn only a 10% return compared to the \"average\" 12% return, then making the opposite decision will cause me to lose 10%, not to make 14%.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  How can an ordinary investor perform poorly compared to the market? The typical investor might perhaps commit a number of missteps. Moreover, one must also consider transaction fees (including the cost of borrowing on margin), leading to a consistent reduction in returns across the market. For instance, if transaction and borrowing expenses amount to 1%, and the market yields a 5% return, then the ordinary investor falls behind. Alternatively, if one describes \"average\" as the population's mean, not weighted by value, it's conceivable that the larger pool of small investors performs slightly less effectively than the fewer larger investors, due to higher relative transaction costs, thus showing a lower mean on an individual basis. Would it not suggest that an investor can continuously exceed the market by making inverse decisions, given that investors can continually fall short of the market by making erroneous decisions? This isn't the case. If my investing tactics cause me to achieve a 10% return instead of a 12% return on average, reversing my decisions would result in a 10% loss, not a 14% profit.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The reason to put more money down or accept a shorter maximum term is because the bank sweetens the deal (or fails to sour it in some fashion).  For example, typically, if there is less than 20% down, you have to pay an premium called \"Private Mortgage Insurance\", which makes it bad deal. But I see banks offering the same rate for a 15%-year mortgage as for a 30-year one, and I think: fools and their money.  Take the 30-year and, if you feel like it pay more every month.  Although why you would feel like it, I don't know, since it's very difficult to get that money back if you need it.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  One reason for increasing your down payment or opting for a shorter maximum term is due to the incentives provided by banks (or the lack of potential disadvantages). Often, if your down payment is less than 20%, you're required to take on an additional cost known as \"Private Mortgage Insurance\", which results in an unfavorable agreement. I've observed that banks often promote the same interest rates for 15-year mortgages as 30-year ones, which leads me to ponder: the folly of individuals and their finance. Opt for the 30-year mortgage and pay more monthly if you desire. However, I can't comprehend why you'd want to, given the challenges of recovering that money should you require it.\n",

      "Reference Response:  For the vast majority, \"buying\" a house via a mortgage is not an investment.  I use quotes around buying because from a technical perspective you don't own anything until you've paid it off; this is often an important point that people forget. It's highly unlikely you'll make more on it than the amount you put into it (interest, repairs, etc).  Even with relatively low interest rates. The people who successfully invest in homes are those that use actual cash (not borrowed) to buy a home at well below market value.  They then clean it up and make enough repairs to make it marketable and sell it shortly there after.  Sometimes these people get hosed if the housing market tumbles to the point that the home is now worth less than the amount they put into it.  This is especially problematic if they used bank loans to get the process going.  They were actually the hardest hit when the housing bubble popped several years ago.  Well, them and the people who bought on interest only loans or had balloon payments. Whereas the people who use a mortgage are essentially treating it like a bank account with a negative interest rate.  For example, $180k loan on a 30 yr fixed at 4% will mean a total payout of around $310k, excluding normal repairs like roofs, carpet, etc.  Due to how mortgage's work, most of the interest is collected during the first half of the loan period.  So selling it within 2 to 5 years is usually problematic unless the local housing market has really skyrocketed. Housing markets move up and down all the time due to a hundred different things completely out of your control.  It might be a regional depression, weather events, failed large businesses, failed city/local governments, etc.  It could go up because businesses moved in, a new highway is built, state/local taxes decline, etc. My point is, homes are not long term investments.  They can be short term ones, but only in limited circumstances and there is a high degree of risk involved.  So don't let that be a driving point of your decision. Instead you need to focus on other factors.  Such as: what is really going on with the house you are currently in?  Why would they lose it?  Can you help out, and, should you help out?  If things are precarious, it might make more sense to sell that home now and everyone move into separate locations, possibly different rentals or apartments.  If they are foreclosed on then they will be in a world of financial hurt for a long time. If we ignore your parents situation, then one piece of advice I would give you is this: Rent the cheapest apartment you can find that is still a \"safe\" place to live in.  Put every dollar you can into some type of savings/investment that will actually grow.  Stay there for 5+ years, then go pay cash for a nice home.  Making $75k a year while single means that you don't need much to live on.  In other words, live extremely cheap now so you can enjoy a fantastic living experience later that is free from financial fear.  You should be able to put $30k+ per year aside going this route. edit: A bit of support data for those that somehow think buying a home on a mortgage is somehow a good investment:   Robert Shiller, who won a Nobel prize in economics and who predicted the bursting of the housing bubble, has shown that a house is not a good investment.  Why?  First, home prices (adjusted for inflation) have been virtually unchanged for the past 100 years.  (link 1, link 2)  Second, after you add in the costs of maintenance alone then those costs plus what you've paid for the home will exceed what you get out of it.  Adding in the cost of a mortgage could easily double or even triple the price you paid which makes things even worse.  Maintenance costs include things like a new roof, carpet/flooring, water heater, appliances, etc. Yes, a home might cost you $100k and you might sell it for $200k after 15 years.  However during that time you'll likely replace the roof ($10k to $20k), replace appliances ($2k to $5k), water heater ($1k), carpet/flooring ($5k to $20k), paint ($3k to $6k), and mortgage related costs (~$60k - assuming 30 yr fixed @4%).  So your \"costs\" are between $180k and $200k just on those items.  There are many more that could easily escalate the costs further.  Like a fence ($5k+), air conditioner ($5k+), windows, etc. The above is assuming the home actually appreciates in value faster than inflation: which they historically haven't over the long term.   So you have to consider all of the costs ultimately paid to purchase and maintain the home vs the costs of renting during the same time period.   Point is: do your research and be realistic about it.  Buying a home is a huge financial risk.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In most instances, acquiring a house through a mortgage isn't really considered an investment. Often, people overlook the fact that ownership technically isn't attained until the mortgage is fully paid. Chances are, the amount you spend on the property (interest, upkeep, and so on) will surpass any potential profit, even at comparatively low interest rates. The ones who profit from housing investments are the ones who utilize their own capital to purchase properties considerably below market value, refurbish them to a sellable condition and quickly resell them. These individuals can face a harsh reality if the housing market falls and the property ends up valuing less than the sum invested in it. This is especially critical if they relied on bank loans to kickstart the procedure. They experienced the strongest blow when the housing bubble burst years back, along with those taking interest-only loans or facing balloon payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, mortgage users are essentially handling it similar to a bank account that comes with a negative interest rate. For instance, a $180k loan on a 30 years term at 4% interest concludes with a total payout of approximately $310k, not considering common maintenance like rooftops, carpeting, and so forth. Because most interest from a mortgage is charged within the first half of the loan period, selling the property within 2-5 years may be difficult unless the local property market strongly escalates. Housing markets are always fluctuating due to numerous unpredictable factors. \n",
      "\n",
      "Houses, therefore, are not long-term investments. They can be short term ones, but these come with their own set of risks and should not be the main factor influencing your decision. Rather, other aspects should be prioritized, such as understanding your current housing situation and assessing if you should, and could, aid anyone. If foreclosure looks imminent, it might be savvy to sell the house and contemplate separate living arrangements, maybe in rental properties or apartments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ignoring your parents' situation, one piece of advice I'd offer is this: Opt for the safest yet cheapest apartment you can find. Allocate every dollar you can save into some investment that will eventually yield growth. Stick around for at least five years, then consider buying a home in cash. Earning a decent annual income while being single allows you to minimize your cost of living. In short, live modestly for the time being, and prepare for a rewarding future devoid of financial worries. By following this method, you should be able to save more than $30k each year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's clear a misconception for those who believe owning a home via a mortgage is profitable: Robert Shiller, a Nobel prize winner for economics who warned about the housing bubble collapse, argues that home buying doesn't make a sound investment. Homes' prices have stayed constant over the last century after adjusting for inflation. Factor in overall maintenance cost, and what you've spent on the house will exceed any potential returns, possibly tripling your original purchase price should you take the cost of a mortgage into account. This is why undertaking deep research and a realistic evaluation of the situation is essential before diving into home acquisition, as it involves significant financial risk.\n",

It has been adopted by companies which are not banks but wish to appear as such, and satisfy legal restrictions on the usage of the word bank. ... For instance, if the original company is known as Bank of America, then the new investment banking entity may be known as Banc of America Securities LLC. If the original company is known as Bank of Manhattan, then its insurance business might be known as \"Banc of Manhattan Insurance\" and its holding company might be called \"Manhattan Bancorp\". This practice originates from legal necessity: Under the laws of most states, a corporation may only use the word \"bank\" in its name if it has obtained a banking charter under state or federal banking laws. So, \"Banc of America\" is the subsidiary of BoA that doesn't have appropriate licenses to be called \"bank\". Wonders of complex regulation :)\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The term Banq (alternatively spelled as Banc, banc-corp, bancorp, or bancorporation) is a deliberate misspelling of the term \"bank\", keeping the pronunciation unchanged. It is a strategy adopted by organizations that, while not technically banks, want to present themselves as such, and to meet legal limitations placed on the employment of the term \"bank\". For instance, if the original entity is recognized as Bank of America, the new investment banking entity might be labelled Banc of America Securities LLC. If the reference company is the Bank of Manhattan, its insurance arm could take the name \"Banc of Manhattan Insurance\", and its parent company might be referred to as \"Manhattan Bancorp\". This naming convention stems from legal requirements: In most states, a corporation can only include the word \"bank\" in its name if it has procured a banking charter under state or federal banking regulations.

      "Reference Response:  Yes, stock price is determined by the last trade price. There are always going to be people who have put in a price to buy a stock (called a bid price) and people who have put in a price to sell a stock (called an ask price). Based on your example, if the last trade price for the stock was $1.23, then you might have the following bid prices and ask prices: So if you put in a limit order to buy 100 shares at $100, you would buy the 40 shares at $1.23, the 15 shares at $1.24, and the 45 shares $1.25.  The price of the stock would go up to $1.25. Conversely, if you put in a limit order to sell 100 shares at $0.01 (I don't think any broker would allow a sell price of $0.00), you would sell 30 shares at $1.22, 20 shares at $1.21, and 50 shares at $1.20.  The price of the stock would go down to $1.20.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Indeed, the last trading price establishes the value of a stock. The constant existence of individuals who have set a buying price for a stock, also known as a bid price, and those who have set a selling price for the stock, referred to as an ask price, influences this. In line with your example, let's presume the last traded price for the stock was $1.23, thus resulting in the subsequent bid and ask prices: If you decide to place a limit order to buy 100 shares at $100, you would acquire 40 shares at $1.23, 15 shares at $1.24, and 45 shares at $1.25. As a result, the stock price would rise to $1.25. Conversely, let's say you place a limit order to sell 100 shares at $0.01 (it's unlikely any broker would permit a selling price of $0.00), you would dispose of 30 shares at $1.22, 20 shares at $1.21, and 50 shares at $1.20.

      "Reference Response:  As the other answers suggest, there are a number of ways of going about it and the correct one will be dependent on your situation (amount of equity in your current house, cashflow primarily, amount of time between purchase and sale). If you have a fair amount of equity (for example, $50K mortgage remaining on a house valued at $300K), I'll propose an option that's similar to bridge financing: Place an offer on your new house. Use some of your equity as part of the down payment (eg, $130K). Use some more of your equity as a cash buffer to allow you pay two mortgages in between the purchase and the sale (eg, $30K). The way this would be executed is that your existing mortgage would be discharged and replaced with larger mortgage. The proceeds of that mortgage would be split between the down payment and cash as you desire. Between the closing of your purchase and the closing of your sale, you'll be paying two mortgages and you'll be responsible for two properties. Not fun, but your cash buffer is there to sustain you through this. When the sale of your new home closes, you'll be breaking the mortgage on that house. When you get the proceeds of the sale, it would be a good time to use any lump sum/prepayment privileges you have on the mortgage of the new house.  You'll be paying legal fees for each transaction and penalties for each mortgage you break. However, the interest rates will be lower than bridge financing. For this reason, this approach will likely be cheaper than bridge financing only if the time between the closing of the two deals is fairly long (eg, at least 6 months), and the penalties for breaking mortgages are reasonable (eg, 3 months interest). You would need the help of a good mortgage broker and a good lawyer, but you would also have to do your own due diligence - remember that brokers receive a commission for each mortgage they sell. If you won't have any problems selling your current house quickly, bridge financing is likely a better deal. If you need to hold on to it for a while because you need to fix things up or it will be harder to sell, you can consider this approach.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The other responses indicate that there are several methods to manage this, and the best one for you will depend on your specific circumstances, such as the equity in your present house, your cash flow, and the length of time between buying and selling. Suppose there's substantial equity in your home, like a remaining mortgage of $50K on a house appraised at $300K. I'd then suggest a strategy comparable to bridge financing: \n",
      "\n",
      "Put forward an offer on your new home, using some of the equity for the down payment, say $130K. Allocate further equity, say $30K, as a financial cushion to cover double mortgages during the period between the purchase and the sale. This would be implemented by discharging your current mortgage and substituting it with a larger one. The mortgage's profits would be divided between the down payment and cash based on your preference. \n",
      "\n",
      "Between the completion of your acquisition and the disposal of your property, you'll juggle two mortgages and manage two properties. It might not be pleasant, but the financial cushion is there for support. When your new home's sale is completed, you'll terminate the mortgage on that property. When you receive the sale proceeds, it might be the ideal moment to utilize any lump-sum/prepayment options you may have on the new home's mortgage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take note that legal fees will apply for each transaction and penalties will occur for every mortgage broken. Despite this, the interest rates will be less than bridge financing. For this reason, this strategy could be more cost-effective than bridge financing if there's a lengthy gap (like at least six months) between the two transactions, and if the penalties for terminating mortgages are fair (like 3 months interest). \n",
      "\n",
      "This will necessitate a proficient mortgage broker and lawyer; however, you should undertake your own investigation, bearing in mind mortgage brokers get a commission for every mortgage they broker. If you don't foresee any issues offloading your current house quickly, bridge financing may be more advantageous. But if you need to keep it a bit longer to address repairs or because it'll be a slow sell, this method could be worth considering.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Disputing the remark seems unlikely to move your score, since it is just that -- a remark.  It's hard to say whether the scoring models can/do read the remarks and incorporate them (somehow) into the scoring metric itself. Disputing the revolving account that should be reported as closed is a different matter.  The question there would be what the status of that account is/was.  In other words, is it showing as an open collection or some other status which would indicate the creditor still has a pending claim?  If so, disputing it might have some effect, although nobody would be able to tell you for certain or even how much your score might be affected. If, as you say, that account should have been part of the bankruptcy package then getting that corrected could be important enough to achieve what you're looking for.  You can try it and see, but even if the effect is minor, you still want your credit report to be a true reflection of the facts. I hope this helps. Good luck!\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Challenging the comment may not impact your score, since it's just that - a comment. It's unclear if scoring models are capable or do interpret the comments and integrate them in some way into the scoring measure. Disputing the revolving account that ought to have been listed as closed is another story. The issue here is the status of that account. In simpler terms, does it appear as an open collection or any other status suggesting the lender still has an unsettled claim? If this is the case, your score may be influenced, though it's uncertain how much. Nobody could definitively tell you. If, as you've stated, the account should've been consolidated into the bankruptcy pile, then it's crucial to correct this to achieve your goal. You could give it a shot, and even if the result is minor, it's important that your credit report accurately represents reality. I trust my advice has been of help. Best of luck!\n",

      "Reference Response:  Utilization is near real-time. What that means is that what is reported is what is taken in terms of debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. When a mortgage broker pulls your credit, they will pull the latest balances with the minimum payments. This is what is taken to determine DTI along with your gross monthly income. If you do not pay your account in full before the statement date, then you more than likely will have to wait an additional statement cycle before it reports to the credit bureaus. Therefore, your utilization is dynamic and the history of your utilization month-to-month is not recorded forever. Only the current balance. What is maintained and reported is your payment history. So you want to never be late if you want to be approved anytime soon for a mortgage. A lower DTI will not help your interest rate. As long as you stay away from the maximum DTI for the mortgage vehicle you are attempting to be approved for (VA, FHA, Conventional, etc), then your DTI should not be a concern. If you are borderline at the time of underwriting, you can take the opportunity and pay off the balances. The mortgage company can then do what is called a credit supplement which entails contacting those lenders where you have proven you have a zero balance and manually input the zero balance cards, that have not yet reported to the bureaus, in your final application to the mortgage company for underwriting approval.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Usage is almost instantaneous, implying that what is reported aligns with the debt-to-income (DTI) ratios collected. When a mortgage broker accesses your credit information, they retrieve the most recent balances along with minimal payments. This data is included in the calculation of your DTI alongside your overall monthly revenue. If your account isn't fully settled before the statement's due date, it's probable that you'll have to await another statement cycle before it is reported to credit agencies. Consequently, your usage fluctuates, and the monthly report of your usage does not have a permanent record, only the present balance. The record that is preserved and submitted is your history of payments. Thus, you should never delay payments if you wish to secure a mortgage approval soon. A minimal DTI won't positively affect your interest rate. As long as you steer clear from the upper limit of DTI for the mortgage type you're seeking approval for (be it VA, FHA, Conventional and so on), your DTI needn't worry you. If, during underwriting, you are on the edge, you could choose to pay off your balances. Consequently, the mortgage firm can enact what's called a credit supplement, involving contacting those lenders where you've demonstrated zero balance and manually entering the zero balance cards, which haven’t yet been reported to the bureaus, into your final mortgage company application for underwriting approval.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Imagine that your normal mode of using credit gets you a score of X. As time goes by your score trends upward if the positive items (length of credit) outweigh your negative items. But there are no big increases or decrease in your score. Then you make a one time change to how you use credit. If this is a event that helps your score, there will be a increase in your score. If it is bad thing your score will drop. But if you go back to your standard method of operating your score will drift back to the previous range. Getting a car loan for a few months to get a bump in your credit score, will not sustain your score at the new level indefinitely. Overtime the impact will lessen, and the score will return your your normal range. Spending money on the loan just to buy a temporary higher credit score is throwing away money.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Consider that your habitual usage of credit results in a score of X. Over time, if the positive factors like the age of your credit outweigh the negatives, your score will gradually rise, but with no significant fluctuations. However, a solitary change in your credit usage can affect this. Such a change could be beneficial or detrimental to your score, causing it to go up or down respectively. Nonetheless, reverting to your customary credit behavior will make your score revert to its prior bracket. Taking out a car loan temporarily to boost your credit score won't keep it at that elevated level indefinitely. As time passes, its effect will diminish, and your score will move back into your usual range. Spending money on this loan in an attempt to momentarily inflate your credit score equates to a waste of funds.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Typically, businesses always charge their 'home' currency, so if the shop is in Canada, you will pay Canadian Dollars. Normally you don't have any choices either. Your credit card company will convert it to your currency, using the current international currency exchange rate (pretty good), plus a potential fee between 0 and 5% - depending on your credit card (not so good). If it is a significant amount, or you plan to do that more than once, and if you have multiple credit cards, check first to see which one has the lowest international fee; 0% is not uncommon, but neither is 3 or 4%. If it's a 10$ thingy, it's probably not worth the time; but 4% of 1000 is already 40$... As of right now, the currency exchange rate is 1.33, so you would pay ~75 USD; plus the potential fee, 0$ - 4$. Understand that this exchange rate is floating continuously; it probably won't change much, but it will change.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Usually, businesses charge in the currency of their home country, so if you're shopping in Canada, your transaction will be in Canadian Dollars. You typically don't have any alternate options. Your credit card provider will handle the conversion to your home currency, based on the current international exchange rate, which is quite advantageous. However, the downside is a potential fee ranging from 0 to 5%, contingent on your specific credit card. If the transaction involves a significant sum, or it's something you'll do often, it's wise to find out which of your credit cards offers the lowest international fee. Rates of 0% are not rare, but 3 to 4% is also possible. If the purchase is minor, say, worth 10$, it may not be worth the effort, but 4% of 1000 equates to 40$. The current exchange rate stands at 1.33, putting your payment at approximately 75 USD, plus a possible fee ranging from 0$ to 4$. Remember that exchange rates are variable; changes may be negligible, but changes do occur.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Okay so I am going to break this answer into a couple sections: Okay so first things first. Did you get a good deal? This is challenging to answer for a number of reasons. First, a good deal is relative to the buyers goals. If you're attempting to buy an asset that provides passive income then maybe you met your goal and got a good deal. If you're attempting to buy an asset that provides long term growth, and you purchased above market (I'm speculating of course) then you may have made a bad deal. So how do you determine if you got a good deal? Does your \"Gross Rental Multiplier\" equal that or is less than that of the average GRM in your area. The lower the better.  So how do you use the GRM to determine if you're getting a good deal? Divide your purchase price by the average city (or area) GRM and that will tell you what you should be getting annually in rent.  You can also use the GRM to determine if a future purchase is over or under priced. Just replace purchase price with asking price.  Alright, so these are the tools you can use to decide if you made a bad business deal or not. There are many ways to skin a cat so to speak. These are the tools I use BEFORE I purchase a home. Many people are penny wise and pound foolish. Take your time when making large purchases. It's OKAY to say PASS.  Okay next thing is this new purchase you're looking at. The number one rule when working a franchise is you don't open a second store until you have a perfect working model to go off of. If you've never had to file a tax return for your current rental. Then you need to wait. If you've never read your local and state rental laws. Then you need to WAIT. If you've never had to leave an event early, wake up in the middle of the night, or get a text while you're on a date from one of your tenants. THEN YOU NEED TO WAIT. Give it a year or two. Just learn the unknown about rental properties. Use your first as your test bed. It's WAY more cheaper then if you make a bad mistake and roll it over multiple properties.  Finally I will leave you with this. No one on this site, myself included, knows everything there is to know about real estate. Anyone that claims they do, send their ass packing. This is a complex COMPLEX business. There is always something to learn and if you don't have the passion to continue learning then hand it off to someone who does. There is tax law, rental law, city repair law, contract law and this doesn't even include the stuff that makes you money, like knowing how to leverage low or no money down loans.  Please take some time and go out and learn.  Good luck! -AR\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Alright, let's tackle this reply systematically. Starting off, the accuracy of a good deal is subjective and depends largely on your objectives. Suppose you're seeking an asset that generates passive income, and you've achieved this goal, then you've secured a good deal. Conversely, if you aimed for an asset for long-term growth and paid over market value (just hypothesizing), then it might be a poor deal. How can we quantify a good deal? One way is to use the \"Gross Rental Multiplier\" (GRM). If your GRM meets or falls below the average GRM in your vicinity, it's a good indication. To evaluate a deal using GRM, divide your buying price by the average regional (or city) GRM; it denotes the yearly rent you should be earning. You can also apply GRM to assess if a future asset is disproportionally priced; just substitute the buying price with the asking price. So, these tools aid you in figuring out whether you made a sound or imprudent business decision. 'There are many ways to skin a cat', as they say. These are the strategies I apply BEFORE buying a property. Remember, one should be cautious when making significant purchases and not hesitate to refuse if needed. Now, about this new acquisition you're considering; here's the golden rule of franchise business—you should only open a subsequent store when you've aced the first model. If you've never filed a tax return for your current rental or brushed up on your local and state rental laws, it's time to hit the pause button. If you've never had to skip an event prematurely, been disturbed in the middle of the night, or received a text from a tenant while on a date, YOU NEED TO WAIT. Allow yourself a year or two to familiarize yourself with the ropes of rental properties. This initial investment of time will prove to be far less costly should any error occur and multiply across properties. To conclude, bear in mind that no one here, myself included, claims to be an oracle with all the knowledge about real estate. Real estate is multifaceted, and there's always room for learning. If you're not passionate about constant learning, it's better delegated to someone who is. Knowledge of tax laws, rental laws, city repair laws, contract laws, and even how to exploit low or zero money down loans are just the tip of the iceberg. Investing time to learn is paramount.

      "Reference Response:  If there are a lot of houses for sale, can you be sure that in a year or two you can sell yours? How long does the average house in that area stay on the market before it is sold? What percentage of houses never get sold?  If it can't be sold due to the crowded market you will be forced to rent the house. The question for you then is how much rental income can you get? Compare the rental income to your monthly cost of owning, and managing the house.  One benefit to buying a house in a market that is easy to rent a house would be if you are forced to move quickly, then you aren't stuck being 3 months into a 12 month lease.  Keep in mind that markets can change rather dramatically in just a few years. Housing costs were flat for much of the 90's, then rocketed up in the first half of the last decade, and after a big drop, they are one a slow climb back up. But the actual path they are on depends on the part of the US you are in.  The rule of thumb in the past was based on the fact that over a few years the price would rise enough overcome the closing costs on the two transactions. Unfortunately the slow growth in the 90's meant that many had to bring checks to closing because the equity gained wasn't enough to overcome the closing costs due to low down payment loans.   The fast growth period meant that people got into exotic loans to maximize the potential income when prices were going up 10-20% a year.  When prices dropped some found that they bought houses they couldn't afford, but couldn't sell to break even on the transaction. They were stuck and had to default on the mortgage.  In fact I have never seen a time frame when the rule of thumb ever applied.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Considering the high volume of properties on the market, are you confident that you'll be able to sell yours within a year or two? What's the typical timeframe a house in that area remains on sale before finally being bought? Is there a certain proportion of houses that never find buyers? In the event of a saturated market making it impossible to sell your house, you might have no other choice but to lease it. Then you must consider what kind of rental earnings this would equate to. Assess this revenue against your monthly expenses of maintaining and managing the property. A plus for purchasing a home in a locality where rentals are high in demand is that if you suddenly have to relocate, you're not trapped in a ongoing 12-month lease barely a quarter way through. Remember that market trends can swing significantly within a short span of time. For instance, during most of the 1990s, the price of homes remained stagnant, then it surged in the first half of the subsequent decade. Following a significant decline, they are now gradually rebounding. Yet, the specific progression relies on the region of the U.S you're situated in. Historically, the general assumption was that over several years, the price hike would be sufficient to compensate for the closing costs of the two deals. However, the sluggish development in the 1990s meant that many people had to make another payment at closing because the equity gained from previous deals didn't cover these costs, especially when low deposit loans were taken. The rapid growth phase saw people leaping into uncommon loans to make the most out of the possible profit when prices were escalating at a rate of 10-20% annually. When the prices plunged, some realized that they had purchased homes beyond their financial capability and couldn't sell these properties without making a loss, leading them to default on their mortgages. In truth, I've never witnessed a period when this general assumption actually came into play.\n",

      "Reference Response:  All transactions within an IRA are irrelevant as far as the taxation of the  distributions from the IRA are concerned. You can only take cash from an IRA, and a (cash) distribution from a Traditional IRA is taxable as ordinary income (same as interest from a bank, say) without the advantage of any of the special tax rates for long-term capital gains or qualified dividends even if that cash was generated within the IRA from sales of stock etc. In short, just as with what is alleged to occur with respect to Las Vegas, what happens within the IRA stays within the IRA. Note: some IRA custodians are willing to make a distribution of stock or mutual fund shares to you, so that ownership of the 100 shares of GE, say, that you hold within your IRA is transferred to you in your personal (non-IRA) brokerage account. But, as far as the IRS is concerned, your IRA custodian sold the stock as the closing price on the day of the distribution, gave you the cash, and you promptly bought the 100 shares (at the closing price) in your personal brokerage account with the cash that you received from the IRA. It is just that your custodian saved the transaction fees involved in selling 100 shares of GE stock inside the IRA and you saved the transaction fee for buying 100 shares of GE stock in your personal brokerage account. Your basis in the 100 shares of GE stock is the \"cash_ that you imputedly received as a distribution from the IRA, so that when you sell the shares at some future time, your capital gains (or losses) will be with respect to this basis. The capital gains that occurred within the IRA when the shares were imputedly sold by your IRA custodian remain within the IRA, and you don't get to pay taxes on that at capital gains rates. That being said, I would like to add to what NathanL told you in his answer. Your mother passed away in 2011 and you are now 60 years old (so 54 or 55 in 2011?). It is likely that your mother was over 70.5 years old when she passed away, and so she likely had started taking Required Minimum Distributions from her IRA before her death. So, You should have been taking RMDs from the Inherited IRA starting with Year 2012. (The RMD for 2011, if not taken already by your mother before   she passed away, should have been taken by her estate, and distributed to her heirs in accordance with her will, or, if she died intestate, in accordance with state law and/or probate court directives). There would   not have been any 10% penalty tax due on the RMDs taken by you on the grounds that you were not 59.5 years old as yet; that rule applies to owners (your mom in this case) and not to beneficiaries (you in this case). So, have you taken the RMDs for 2012-2016? Or were you waiting to turn 59.5 before taking distributions in the mistaken belief that you would have to pay a 10% penalty for early wthdrawal?  The penalty for not taking a RMD is 50% of the amount not distributed; yes, 50%. If you didn't take RMDs from the Inherited IRA for years 2012-2016, I recommend that you consult a CPA with expertise in tax law. Ask the CPA if he/she is an Enrolled Agent with the IRS: Enrolled Agents have to pass an exam administered by the IRS to show that they really understand tax law and are not just blowing smoke, and can represent you in front of the IRS in cases of audit etc,\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In the context of the taxation of distributions from an IRA, any transactions within the IRA are not considered. The possibility exists only for cash withdrawal from an IRA, and any cash distributed from a traditional IRA is subject to tax as normal income, without any special tax benefits for long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, even if the cash was obtained through stock sales within the IRA. In simpler terms, what occurs within the IRA remains in the IRA, reminiscent of the saying associated with Las Vegas. It's worth noting that some IRA custodians are agreeable to distribute stock or mutual fund shares to their clients, and thus the 100 shares of GE, for instance, that you own within your IRA can be transferred to your personal brokerage account. But in the IRS' view, your custodian sold the stock at the day's closing price, handed over the cash to you, and you immediately purchased the 100 shares at the closing price in your personal account using the cash from the IRA. This eliminates transaction fees for selling and buying 100 shares of GE stock within your brokerage and IRA accounts, respectively. The perceived cash distribution from the IRA establishes your basis in the 100 shares of GE, and when selling the shares later, your capital gains or losses will refer to this basis. Capital gains resulting from the sale of shares by your IRA custodian remain within the IRA, preventing you from being taxed on it at capital gains rates. To extend on what NathanL conveyed to you earlier, your mother's demise was in 2011 and you're now 60 years old (meaning you were approximately 54 or 55 in 2011?). Likely, your mother was over the age of 70.5 when she died, hence she probably started drawing from her Required Minimum Distributions before dying. Therefore, starting from 2012, you should have begun taking RMDs from the inherited IRA. You'd not have owed any 10% penalty tax on the RMDs, since you were under 59.5; that rule is applicable to account owners (your mother in this case), not beneficiaries. Did you take the RMDs for the period 2012-2016? Or were you waiting to hit 59.5 to avoid the misperceived 10% early withdrawal penalty? If you have missed any RMDs, the consequences include a whopping 50% tax on the undistributed amount. If you've missed RMDs for the period 2012-2016 from the Inherited IRA, seek advice from a CPA specializing in tax law. Ensure they are an Enrolled Agent with the IRS, which implies they passed an IRS-administered test confirming their in-depth knowledge of tax law and can represent you should IRS audits be necessary.\n",

      "Reference Response:  If you're truly ready to pay an extra $1000 every month, and are confident you'll likely always be able to, you should refinance to a 15 year mortgage. 15 year mortgages are typically sold at around a half a point lower interest rates, meaning that instead of your 4.375% APR, you'll get something like 3.875% APR.  That's a lot of money over the course of the mortgage.  You'll end up paying around a thousand a month more - so, exactly what you're thinking of doing - and not only save money from that earlier payment, but also have a lower interest rate.  That 0.5% means something like $25k less over the life of the mortgage.  It's also the difference in about $130 or so a month in your required payment. Now of course you'll be locked into making that larger payment - so the difference between what you're suggesting and this is that you're paying an extra $25k in exchange for the ability to pay it off more slowly (in which case you'd also pay more interest, obviously, but in the best case scenario).  In the 15 year scenario you must make those ~$4000 payments.  In the 30 year scenario you can pay ~$2900 for a while if you lose your job or want to go on vacation or ... whatever. Of course, the reverse is also true: you'll have to make the payments, so you will.  Many people find enforced savings to be a good strategy (myself among them); I have a 15 year mortgage and am happy that I have to make the higher payment, because it means I can't spend that extra money frivolously. So what I'd do if I were you is shop around for a 15 year refi.  It'll cost a few grand, so don't take one unless you can save at least half a point, but if you can, do.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  If you're genuinely prepared and capable of accommodating an added monthly expense of $1000, refinancing to a 15-year mortgage is a recommended move. With a 15-year mortgage, the interest rate is usually about half a point lower, which means that your 4.375% Annual Percentage Rate (APR) could potentially drop to roughly 3.875% APR. This adjustment can have a significant financial impact over time. Essentially, you'll be making an additional $1000 payment monthly, just as you intend to, while also benefitting from a lower interest rate. Thus, you'd save around $25,000 over the mortgage term due to the 0.5% lower rate. It is also equivalent to a roughly $130 monthly decrease in your required payment. As expected, you'll be committed to making the larger payments in the 15-year plan. In contrast, the 30-year plan allows for more flexibility, such as the option to only pay approximately $2900 if circumstances demand. However, the drawback is that you're committing an extra $25k for the ability to spread the payments over a more extended period, during which more interest will accrue. Statistically, compulsory savings prove to be an opportune choice for a lot of people - myself included, with a 15-year mortgage. The obligation to make higher payments restricts me from making imprudent purchases. As such, your best course of action might be to canvass a 15-year mortgage refinance. Such a step would entail certain costs, hence consider it only if you’re guaranteed at least a half-point reduction. If that's achievable, it's worth proceeding with the refinance.\n",

      "Reference Response:  You can look at TIPS (which have some inflation protection built in). Generally short term bonds are better than long if you expect rates to rise soon. Other ways that you can protect yourself are to choose higher yield corporate bonds instead of government bonds, or to use foreign bonds. There are plenty of bond funds like Templeton Global or ETFs that offer such features. Find one that will work for you.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Consider exploring TIPS as they come with a certain level of inflation protection.

      "Reference Response:  The breakeven amount isn't at 8 years. You calculated how many years of paying $500 it would take to break even with one year of paying $4000. 8 x 10 years = 80 years. So by paying $500/year it will take you 80 years to have spent the same amount ($40000 total) as you did in 10 years. At this point it may seem obvious what the better choice is. Consider where you'll be after 10 years: In scenario #1 you've spent $5000 ($500*10) and have to continue spending $500/year indefinitely. In scenario #2 you've spent $40000 ($4000*10) and don't have to pay any more, but you currently have $35000 ($40000 - $5000) less than you did in scenario #1. If you had stayed with scenario #1 you could invest that $35000 at a measly 1.43% annual return and cover the $500 payments indefinitely without ever dipping into your remaining $35000. Most likely over the long term you'll do better than 1.43% per year and come out far ahead.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The calculations for the break-even point are not at 8 years. You determined the number of years you'd be handing over $500 to recover the cost of one year's $4000 payment. The math, 8 times 10 years, equals 80 years. Thus, it takes 80 years of $500 annual payments to equal the same total expenditure of $40000 you made in 10 years. While it might seem clear which option is superior, let's break down the situation after a decade. In the first scenario, you've parted with $5000 ($500 times 10) and will keep shelling out $500 each year. In the second scenario, you've spent $40000 ($4000 times 10) and your payments are finished, but you have $35000 ($40000 minus $5000) less than in the first scenario. Now consider, if you opted for the first scenario, you could invest the amount of $35000 and even with a modest 1.43% annual return, you could offset the $500 yearly payments indefinitely without tapping into your spare $35000. So, it's highly likely that, over considerable time, you'll outdo the 1.43% annual return and come out magnificently in the lead.\n",

The 3 situations they didn't want to be in the first place. And the most important thing is most analysts are dumb bozos, whom you should ignore.

      "Reference Response:  The offering price is what the company will raise by selling the shares at that price.  However, this isn't usually what the general public sees as often there will be shows to drive up demand so that there will be buyers for the stock.  That demand is what you see on the first day when the general public can start buying the stock.  If one is an employee, relative or friend of someone that is offered, \"Friends and Family\" shares they may be able to buy at the offering price. Pricing of IPO from Wikipedia states around the idea of pricing: A company planning an IPO typically appoints a lead manager, known as   a bookrunner, to help it arrive at an appropriate price at which the   shares should be issued. There are two primary ways in which the price   of an IPO can be determined. Either the company, with the help of its   lead managers, fixes a price (\"fixed price method\"), or the price can   be determined through analysis of confidential investor demand data   compiled by the bookrunner (\"book building\"). Historically, some IPOs both globally and in the United States have   been underpriced. The effect of \"initial underpricing\" an IPO is to   generate additional interest in the stock when it first becomes   publicly traded. Flipping, or quickly selling shares for a profit, can   lead to significant gains for investors who have been allocated shares   of the IPO at the offering price. However, underpricing an IPO results   in lost potential capital for the issuer. One extreme example is   theglobe.com IPO which helped fuel the IPO \"mania\" of the late 90's   internet era. Underwritten by Bear Stearns on November 13, 1998, the   IPO was priced at $9 per share. The share price quickly increased   1000% after the opening of trading, to a high of $97. Selling pressure   from institutional flipping eventually drove the stock back down, and   it closed the day at $63. Although the company did raise about $30   million from the offering it is estimated that with the level of   demand for the offering and the volume of trading that took place the   company might have left upwards of $200 million on the table. The danger of overpricing is also an important consideration. If a   stock is offered to the public at a higher price than the market will   pay, the underwriters may have trouble meeting their commitments to   sell shares. Even if they sell all of the issued shares, the stock may   fall in value on the first day of trading. If so, the stock may lose   its marketability and hence even more of its value. This could result   in losses for investors, many of whom being the most favored clients   of the underwriters. Perhaps the best known example of this is the   Facebook IPO in 2012. Underwriters, therefore, take many factors into consideration when   pricing an IPO, and attempt to reach an offering price that is low   enough to stimulate interest in the stock, but high enough to raise an   adequate amount of capital for the company. The process of determining   an optimal price usually involves the underwriters (\"syndicate\")   arranging share purchase commitments from leading institutional   investors. Some researchers (e.g. Geoffrey C., and C. Swift, 2009) believe that   the underpricing of IPOs is less a deliberate act on the part of   issuers and/or underwriters, than the result of an over-reaction on   the part of investors (Friesen & Swift, 2009). One potential method   for determining underpricing is through the use of IPO Underpricing   Algorithms. This may be useful for seeing the difference in that \"theglobe.com\" example where the offering price is $9/share yet the stock traded much higher than that initially.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The price at which a company sells its shares is known as the offering price, which determines the funds the company will generate. However, the general public often sees a different side of the process, where shows are set up to boost demand, thus securing a market for the stocks. This heightened interest is usually evident on the initial trading day when the public is given the right to purchase the stock. A select group, including employees, relatives, or friends of the offerer, might secure \"Friends and Family\" shares at the offering price.\n",
      "\n",
      "As stated on Wikipedia regarding IPO pricing, a business planning an IPO typically collaborates with a main manager, or bookrunner, which helps in setting an appropriate price for issuing the shares. The pricing could either be fixed by the company with the assistance of its lead managers or it can be determined using a bookrunner's compilation of confidential investor demand data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, underpricing has been a common phenomenon in IPOs, both worldwide and in the US. This is a strategy to garner additional interest when the stock first becomes available for public trade. Flipping, or rapidly selling shares for profit, could possibly yield substantial gains for investors who bought the IPO shares at the offering price. However, such underpricing can lead to a potential capital loss for the company issuing the shares. \n",
      "\n",
      "One extreme case of this was theglobe.com's IPO during the '90s internet boom. Priced at $9/share, the stock price soared 1000% in the trading's early hours, reaching a peak of $97. However, selling pressure eventually pulled down the stock value, closing at $63 at day's end. Despite making an estimated $30 million off the offering, the company may have missed out on nearly $200 million due to the level of demand and volume of trading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, overpricing also bears risk. If a stock is sold to the public at a cost higher than the market's willingness to pay, underwriters may find it challenging to fulfill their commitments to sell shares. If share values fall on the first trading day, further loss of value might ensue, potentially leading to investor losses. An infamous case of such overpricing was Facebook's IPO in 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, underwriters have to consider numerous factors when pricing an IPO, aiming for a price that's low enough to attract interest but high enough to raise substantial capital for the company. They usually facilitate share purchase commitments from leading institutional investors to determine this optimal price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some researchers suggest that IPO underpricing may be less a conscious act by issuers and/or underwriters, and more a result of investor overreaction. IPO Underpricing Algorithms could offer a method for determining underpricing, shedding light on cases like that of \"theglobe.com\", where the offering price stood at $9/share, yet the stock traded significantly higher initially.\n",

      "Reference Response:  No, it isn't generally believed that inflation is caused by individual banks printing money.  Governments manage money supply through Central Banks (which may, or may not, be independent of the state). There are a number of theories about money supply and inflation (from Monetarist, to Keynesian, and so on). The Quantity Theory of Inflation says that long-term inflation is the result of money-supply but short-term inflation is related to events/local conditions. Short-term inflation is a symptom of economic change.  It's like a cough for a doctor.  It simply indicates an underlying event. When prices go up it encourages new producers to enter the market, create new supply which will then act to lower prices.  In this way inflation is managed by ensuring that information travels throughout the economy.  If prices go up for specific goods, then - all things being equal - supply should go up since the increase implies increasing demand.  If prices go down then this implies demand has gone down and so producers will reduce supply. Obviously this isn't a perfect relationship.  There is \"stickiness\" which can be caused by a whole bunch of market conditions (from banning of short-selling, to inelasticity of demand/supply). Your question isn't about quantitative easing (which is a state-led way of increasing money-supply and which could increase inflation but is hoped to increase expenditure and investment) so I won't cover that here. The important take-away is that inflation is an essential price signal to investors and business people so that they can assess market cycles.  Without it we would end up with vast over- or under-supply and much greater economic disruption.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Generally, it's not accepted that individual banks printing money triggers inflation. The task of managing the money supply is usually handled by Central Banks under the control of governments, although their independence can vary. Various theories outline the relationship between money supply and inflation, from Monetarist to Keynesian perspectives, among others. The Quantity Theory of Inflation suggests that while money supply impacts long-term inflation, short-term inflation is respondent to local circumstances and events, essentially reflecting economic changes. It can be likened to a doctor's cough, signifying an underlying situation. \n",
      "When inflation causes prices to rise, it tends to motivate new producers to join the market, thus increasing supply which eventually results in price depreciation. By allowing information to circulate freely within an economy, inflation can be effectively controlled. An increase in prices for certain goods indicates higher demand, assuming all other conditions remain constant, and should lead to increased supply. Conversely, decreased prices suggest a fall in demand, leading to reduced supply. However, this relationship isn't flawlessly balanced due to \"stickiness\" that can originate from diverse market conditions, spanning from the prohibition of short-selling to inelasticity of demand/supply. \n",
      "This discussion intentionally omits quantitative easing, a method by which the government expands money supply potentially escalating inflation yet intended to boost expenditure and investment. The crucial point to remember is that inflation delivers important price signals to investors and businesses for assessing market cycles. A lack of such signals could result in severe over or under-supply, leading to major economic upheaval.\n",

Most likely, your landlord will have no issues accepting these, although it's always wise to verify this beforehand. It's advisable to purchase multiple due to the restriction of obtaining a single money order exceeding $1000, and there's usually a limit of purchasing more than three per day.

      "Reference Response:  As far as I know, the AMT implications are the same for a privately held company as for one that is publicly traded.  When I was given my ISO package, it came with a big package of articles on AMT to encourage me to exercise as close to the strike price as possible.  Remember that the further the actual price at the time of purchase is from the strike price, the more the likely liability for AMT.  That is an argument for buying early.  Your company should have a common metric for determining the price of the stock that is vetted by outside sources and stable from year to year that is used in a similar way to the publicly traded value when determining AMT liability. During acquisitions stock options often, from what I know of my industry, at least, become options in the new company's stock.  This won't always happen, but its possible that your options will simply translate.  This can be valuable, because the price of stock during acquisition may triple or quadruple (unless the acquisition is helping out a very troubled company). As long as you are confident that the company will one day be acquired rather than fold and you are able to hold the stock until that one day comes, or you'll be able to sell it back at a likely gain, other than tying up the money I don't see much of a downside to investing now.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  To the best of my knowledge, the impact of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) appears to be consistent whether for a privately owned company or a public one. When I received my Incentive Stock Option (ISO) package, it was accompanied by a wealth of articles on AMT, advising me to aim to exercise as close to the strike price as achievable. Keep in mind that the further the actual price at the time of acquisition deviates from the strike price, the higher the potential AMT liability. This suggests that it might be beneficial to make your purchase sooner than later. Your corporation should possess a standard measurement for establishing the stock price, validated by external entities and remains consistent from year to year, serving a similar purpose to the publicly traded value in determining the AMT liability. It is common during mergers for stock options, at least based on my industry understanding, to transition into options in the new firm's stock. It's not guaranteed, but the possibility remains that your options will seamlessly transfer. This can be advantageous, as the stock price during a merger can multiply (unless the organization being acquired is severely distressed). Provided you're confident that the firm will eventually be purchased rather than going bust, and you can keep the stock until this happens, or you're able to sell it back likely at a profit, investing now doesn't seem to come with much risk apart from tying up your assets.\n",

      "Reference Response:  What you are seeing is the effects of inflation. As money becomes less valuable it takes more of it to buy physical things, be they commodities, shares in a company's stock, and peoples time (salaries).  Just about the only thing that doesn't track inflation to some degree is cash itself or money in an account since that is itself what is being devalued.  So the point of all this is, buying anything (a house, gold, stocks) that doesn't depreciate (a car) is something of a hedge against inflation. However, don't be tricked (as many are) into thinking that house just made you a tidy sum just because it went up in value so much over x years. Remember 1) All the other houses and things you'd spend the money on are a lot more expensive now too; and 2) You put a lot more money into a house than the mortgage payment (taxes, insurance, maintenance, etc.) I'm with the others though. Don't get caught up in the gold bubble. Doing so now is just speculation and has a lot of risk associated with it.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  What you're observing is the impact of inflation. As the value of money decreases, it requires more of it to purchase tangible items, whether that's commodities, a piece of a corporation, or a person's time such as their salary. Essentially, the only element that doesn't mirror inflation to some extent is the currency itself or the funds in an account, since this is the very entity undergoing devaluation. Thus, this is to say, purchasing anything (like a house, gold, stocks) that doesn't lose its value (unlike a car) serves as a sort of protection against inflation. Yet, you shouldn't be fooled (like many people are) into believing that your house has earned you a neat profit simply because its value has surged over a certain number of years. Keep in mind that 1) All other houses and items you'd use the money for have also become more pricey; and 2) You invest more money in a home than just the mortgage payment including things like taxes, insurance, and upkeep. I agree with the others though - don't get swept up in the gold rush. Engaging in it now is mere speculation and comes with its share of risks.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Index funds, like IBB, generally lack active management, which equates to lower expenses. This is simply because the target index, the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index in the case of IBB, is composed of known quantities. This means there won't be stock pickers or analysts constantly swapping holdings, increasing the turnover rate of the portfolio and increasing capital gains; costs that are offset by higher expense ratios in more actively managed funds.\n",

The reason is straightforward: the target index, for IBB specifically, it's the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index, consists of established components. Consequently, there won't be constant shifts in holdings by stock selectors or analysts. Such activities would uptick the portfolio's turnover rate and raise the capital gains, expenses which are counterbalanced by greater expense ratios in funds that are managed more actively.\n",

      "Reference Response:  You're potentially in very deep water here. You don't know who this person is that you're dealing with.  Before you'd even met him, he just gave you his banking info, seemingly without a second thought.   You have no idea what the sources of his money are, so what happens if the money is stolen or otherwise illegal?  If it is determined that you used any of that money, you'll be on the hook to return it, at the very least.  Who knows what the legal ramifications are either? So it sounds like you began spending his money before you had any kind of written agreement in place?  Doesn't that seem odd to you to have someone just so trusting as to not even ask for that? Was the source of the email about the $2500 from PayPal, or from him or his advisor?  PayPal always sends you a notice directly when funds are received into your account, and even if they were going to put a temporary hold on them for whatever reason (sometimes they do that), it would still show up in your account. I would HIGHLY (can I be more emphatic?) advise you not to go anywhere NEAR his bank account until or unless you can absolutely verify who he is, where his money comes from, and what the situation is. If you start dipping into his account, whether you think you're somehow entitled to the money or not, he could cry foul and have you arrested for theft. This is a very odd situation, and for someone who says he's normally cautious and skeptical, you sure let your guard down here when you started spending his money without making any serious effort to confirm his bona fides. Just because he passes himself off as smart and the \"doctor type\" doesn't mean squat.  The very best scammers can do that (ever see the movie \"Catch Me If You Can\", based on a true story?), so you have no basis for knowing he's anything at all. I am thoroughly confused as to why you'd just willfully start using his money without knowing anything about him.  That's deeply disconcerting, because you've opened yourself up to a world of potential criminal and civil liability if this situation goes south. If this guy was giving you money as an investment in your business and you instead used some of that money for your own personal expenses then you could land in very serious trouble for co-mingling of funds.  Even if he told you it was okay, it doesn't sound like there's anything in writing, so he could just as easily deny giving you permission to use the money that way and have you charged with embezzlement. You need to step back, take a deep breath, stop using his money, and contact a lawyer for advice.  Every attorney will give you a free consultation, and you need to protect yourself here. Be careful, my friend.  If this makes you suspicious then you need to listen to that voice in your head and find a way to get out of this situation.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  It appears that you're treading on thin ice here. You're dealing with a person whose identity you haven't established. He casually handed over his bank details before you met him, without apparent hesitation. The origin of his funds is a complete mystery to you. What if those funds come from theft or other illicit activities? If you're found to have used such unlawfully-obtained money, you might be legally obligated to return it, or worse. The legal consequences could be significant. It seems like you've already started spending his funds without a formal agreement. Doesn't his unquestioning trust strike you as strange? Regarding the $2500 email, did it come from PayPal, him or his associate? PayPal directly informs you when funds are deposited into your account, even if they place them on a temporary hold for whatever reason, it should reflect in your account. I urge you with utmost earnestness to avoid any transactions from his bank account until you have thoroughly established his identity, the legitimacy of his funds and the overall situation. If you continue using his funds, regardless of whether you believe you have a right to them or not, he could potentially accuse you of theft and have you arrested. The situation is highly unusual, and despite your usual cautious nature, it seems your guard has unexpectedly dropped when you began using his funds without confirming his credibility. The fact that he presents himself as intelligent and a ‘doctor-type’ does nothing to validate his authenticity. Seasoned fraudsters can put on a convincing façade (as illustrated by the movie \"Catch Me If You Can\", which is based on a real-life event), so you really can't be certain he's legitimate in any way. It's puzzling why you'd freely use his money while having no knowledge of who he truly is. This is alarming, as it exposes you to potential legal ramifications and possible criminal charges if things go awry. If he gave you the money as an investment in your business and you spent it on your personal needs, then you could find yourself in a dire situation for misuse of the funds. Even if he verbally consented to you using the funds for personal expenses, the absence of a written agreement leaves room for him to refute it and accuse you of misappropriation of funds. I would recommend that you take a step back, cease using his funds for now, and consult with an attorney. Every lawyer offers a complimentary consultation and it's crucial that you safeguard your interests. Proceed with caution, my friend. If this whole situation evokes suspicion, heed your instinct and extricate yourself from the situation.\n",

But companies heavily tied to ocean shipping can be ripe for speculation. The baltic dry index is created for this analytical purpose, and that information can be used as an indicator to hedge or speculate in container freight swap agreements.  The Guggenheim Shipping Exchange Traded Fund also serves as a proxy for maritime shipping profitability, but it is just a bundle of several publicly traded marine shipping companies shares.\n",

Making guesses about marine commerce has a stronger correlation to petroleum transactions and oceanic freight rates as compared to any specific firms. That said, businesses that depend majorly on marine shipping could potentially be conjectured. The crafting of the Baltic Dry Index caters to this evaluative function, with its data serving as an insightful gauge to hedge or speculate over container freight swap contracts.

      "Reference Response:  In theory, in a perfect world, what you state is almost true. Apart from transaction fees, if you assume that the market is perfectly efficient (ie: public information is immediately reflected in a perfect reflection of future share value, in all share prices when the information becomes available), then in theory any transaction you would choose to take is opposed by a reasonable person who is not taking advantage of you, just moving their position around. This would make any and all transactions completely reasonable from a cost-benefit perspective.  ie: if the future value of all dividends to be paid by Apple [ie: the value of holding a share in Apple] exactly matches Apple's share price of $1,000, then buying a share for $1,000 is an even trade. Selling a share for $1,000 is also an even trade. Now in a perfectly efficient market, which we have assumed, then there is no edge to valuing a company using your own methods. If you take Apple's financial statements / press releases / reported information, and if you apply modern financial theory to evaluate the future dividends from Apple, you should get the same $1,000 share price that the market has already arrived at. So in this example, why wouldn't you just throw darts at a printout of the S&P 500 and invest in whatever it lands on? Because, even if the 'perfectly efficient market' agrees on the true value of something, different investments have different characteristics. As an example, consider a simple comparison of corporate bonds: Corporations make bond offerings to the public, allowing individual investors to effectively lend money to the corporation, for a future benefit. For simplicity, assume a bond with a 'face value' (the amount to be repaid to the investor on maturity) of $1,000 has these 3 defining characteristics: (1) The price [What the investor pays to acquire it]; (2) Interest payments [how much, if any, the corporation will pay to the investor before maturity, and when those payments will be made]; and (3) a bond rating [which is a third party assessment of how risky the bond is, based on the 'health' of the corporation]. Now if the bond rating agency is perfect in its risk assessment, and if the price of all bond's is fair, then why does it matter who you loan your money to? It matters because different people want different things out of their investments. If you are waiting to make a down payment on a house next year, then you don't want risk - you want to be certain that you will get your cash back, even if it means lower returns. So, even though a high-risk bond may be perfectly priced, it should only be bought by someone willing to bear that risk. If you are retired, and you need your bonds to pay you interest regularly as your sole source of income, then of course a zero-coupon bond [one that pays no interest] is not helpful to you. If you are young, and have a long time to invest, then you may want risk, because you have time to overcome losses and you want to get the most return possible. In addition, taxes are not universal between all investors. Some people benefit from things that would be tax-heavy to their neighbors. For example in Canada, there is a 'dividend tax credit' which reduces the taxes owing on dividends received by a corporation. This credit exists to prevent 'double-taxation', because otherwise the corporation would pay its ~30% of tax, and then a wealthy investor would pay another ~45% of tax. Due to the mechanics of how the credit is calculated, however, someone who makes less money, gets an even lower tax bill than they normally would. This means that someone making under the top tax bracket in Canada, has a tax benefit by receiving dividends. This means that while 2 stocks may be both fairly priced, if one pays dividends and the other doesn't [ie: if the other company instead reinvests more heavily in future projects, creating even more value for shareholders down the road], then someone in the bottom tax brackets may want the dividend paying stock more than the other. In conclusion: Picking investments yourself does require some knowledge to prevent yourself from making a 'bad buy'; this is because the market is not perfectly efficient. As well, specific market mechanics make some trades more costly than they should be in theory; consider for example transaction fees and tax mechanics. Finally, even if you assume that all of the above is irrelevant as a theoretical idea, different investors still have different needs. Just because $1,000,000 is the 'fair' price for a factory in your home town, doesn't mean you might as well convert your retirement savings to buy it as your sole asset.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Hypothetically, in an idealistic scenario, your assertions are nearly accurate. Leaving aside transaction costs, supposing the market operates with flawless efficiency (meaning: any published news is instantly mirrored in the accurate prediction of future stock value, throughout all stock prices as the information emerges), then ideally, any transaction you decide to undertake is countered by a rational individual who isn't exploiting you, merely shifting their stance. This would render all transactions entirely justifiable from a cost-benefit viewpoint. That is, if the projected value of all dividends from Apple [i.e., the worth of owning an Apple share] precisely equals Apple's $1,000 share price, purchasing a share for $1,000 is an equal exchange. Selling a share for the same amount is equally fair. In a perfectly efficient market, under our assumption, there's no advantage to appraising a company using your personal criteria. Supposing you take Apple's financial records/ press announcements/ disclosed information, and apply contemporary financial methods to determine the prospective dividends from Apple, you should get the same $1,000 share price which the market has already calculated. Thus, in this instance, why wouldn't you blindly throw darts at an S&P 500 chart and invest in wherever the dart sticks? The reason is, even though the 'super-efficient market' agrees on the accurate value of something, diverse investments hold distinct characteristics. For illustration, consider an elementary comparison of business bonds: Companies issue bond offers to the public, allowing private investors to effectively lend money to the company, for a future return. For clarity, let's assume a bond with a 'face value' (the money to be reimbursed to the investor at maturity) of $1,000 has three main features: (1) The price [what the investor spends to obtain it]; (2) Interest payments [the quantity, if any, the company will pay the investor before maturity, and when those payments will be carried out]; and (3) a bond rating [a third party's estimation of the bond's risk based on the 'health' of the company]. So, if the bond rating agency flawlessly assesses risk, and if the price of all bonds is just, then why does it matter who you lend your money to? It matters since different investors have varying investment aspirations. If you're anticipating making a down payment on a house next year, you value stability over risk - you want assurance on receiving your money back, even if it implies lower returns. Hence, a high-risk bond, while possibly accurately priced, should solely be bought by an individual prepared to handle that risk. If you're retired and rely on regular interest payments from your bonds as your primary income, clearly, a zero-coupon bond [one that does not provide interest] is of no use to you. If you're young with a longer horizon for investment, then you may favor risk, since you can cope with losses and you're aiming for the highest potential return. Also, tax nuances do not apply equally to all investors. Some investors gain from the situations which impose a heavy tax burden on their neighbors. For instance in Canada, the 'dividend tax credit' reduces the tax obligation on dividends acquired from a company. This concession is designed to avert 'double taxation', but due to the computation of the credit, it means someone earning less than the top tax threshold in Canada gets a tax benefit from receiving dividends. Hence, while two stocks might both be fairly priced, if one pays dividends and the other does not [i.e., if the latter company opts to reinvest more substantially into future ventures, generating further value for its shareholders], an individual in the lower tax brackets may prefer the stock paying dividends. To conclude: Although choosing investments on your own needs some level of knowledge to guard against a 'bad buy', it is because the market doesn’t function with perfect efficiency. Moreover, certain market mechanics result in some transactions being more expensive than they should theoretically be; examples include transaction fees and tax mechanics. Ultimately, even discarding all of the above on theoretical grounds, varying investors still have distinct requirements. Just because a factory in your hometown is fairly priced at $1,000,000 doesn't mean you should exhaust your retirement savings to purchase it as your sole asset.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Money itself has no value. A gold bar is worth (fuzzy rushed math, could be totally wrong on this example figure) $423,768.67. So, a 1000 dollars, while worthless paper, are a token saying that you own %.2 of a gold bar in the federal reserve. If a billion dollars are printed, but no new gold is added to the treasury, then your dollar will devalue, and youll only have %.1 percent of that gold bar (again, made up math to describe a hypothetical). When dollars are introduced into the economy, but gold has not been introduced to back it up, things like the government just printing dollars or banks inventing money out of debt (see the housing bubble), then the dollar tokens devalue further. TL;DR: Inflation is the ratio of actual wealth in the Treasury to the amount of currency tokens the treasury has printed.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The intrinsic value of money is actually nonexistent. For instance, a gold ingot may be valued at a hypothetical $423,768.67. Therefore, when we say 1000 dollars, even though it's just paper, it symbolizes ownership of about 0.2% of a gold bar in the national reserve. If the treasury prints additional billion dollars without adding any new gold, it results in a decrease in the value of your dollar, leaving you with just 0.1% ownership of that gold bar (this, of course, is a fabricated example). In cases where new currency is injected into the economy without corresponding gold to support it - such as government excess printing or banks creating money from debt like during the housing bubble - the value of these dollar tokens further depreciates. Put simply: Inflation reflects the disparity between the real wealth present in the Treasury and the quantity of printed paper money.\n",

      "Reference Response:  My simplest approach is to suggest that people go Roth when in the 15% bracket, and use pre-tax to avoid 25%. I outlined that strategy in my article The 15% solution.  The monkey wrench that gets thrown in to this is the distortion of the other smooth marginal tax curve caused by the taxation of social security. For those who can afford to, it makes the case to lean toward Roth as much as possible.  I'd suggest always depositing pretax, and using conversions to better control the process. Two major benefits to this. It's less a question of too late than of what strategy to use.\n",

For those who can afford it, there is a strong argument to favor Roth as much as they can. I propose always investing pretax, and employ conversions for better management of the process.

      "Reference Response:  The reason to have disability insurance is to replace your income if you become disabled and are no longer able to work.  For this purpose, it is kind of similar to life insurance where you want to replace your income to take care of people that depend on your income if you die, but now you are included in the people that depend on your income.   If your employer doesn't provide any disability insurance then it would be wise to look for some Long Term disability insurance.  Short Term disability is more expensive than long term and it is USUALLY better and cheaper to have a good emergency fund to provide for a short term disability such as being sick for a month and not able to work than to buy short-term.  As a web developer - you should be able to get long term disability insurance at a reasonable cost, unless you have some dangerous hobbies like forest fire fighting or shark juggling.\n",

It somewhat mirrors life insurance in the sense of safeguarding your income for those who rely on it if you pass away; only now, you're part of that dependent group. In case your employer doesn't offer any disability insurance, it's recommended to seek Long Term disability insurance. Short Term disability tends to be costlier than Long term, and it's normally preferable and more affordable to maintain a robust emergency fund for temporary disability situations, like an illness that prevents you from working for a month, rather than investing in short-term insurance.

      "Reference Response:  An investment is sold when you sell that particular stock or fund. It doesn't wait until you withdraw cash from the brokerage account. Whether an investment is subject to long term or short term taxes depends on how long you held that particular stock. Sorry, you can't get around the higher short term tax by leaving the money in a brokerage account or re-investing in something else. If you are invested in a mutual fund, whether it's long or short term depends on when you buy and sell the fund. The fact that the fund managers are buying and selling behind your back doesn't affect this. (I don't know what taxes they have to pay, maybe you really are paying for it in the form of management fees or lower returns, but you don't explicitly pay the tax on these \"inner\" transactions.) Your broker should send you a tax statement every year giving the numbers that you need to fill in to the various boxes of your income tax form. You don't have to figure it out. Of course it helps to know the rules. If you've held a stock for 11 1/2 months and are planning to sell, you might want to consider waiting a couple of weeks so it becomes a long term capital gain rather than short term and thus subject to lower tax.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The moment you sell a specific stock or fund represents the selling point of an investment, not when you withdraw money from the investment account. The taxation category of a particular investment - long or short term - is dependent on the period the investment was held, and regrettably, keeping the funds within the investment account or re-investing doesn't bypass a higher short-term tax. For those holding investments in mutual funds, the tax period is determined by when the fund was bought and sold. Irrespective of the trading activities conducted by portfolio managers in the backdrop, it doesn't impact this. While I'm uncertain about the kind of tax they incur, it's possible it might indirectly cost you through management expenses or reduced returns. You don't pay any visible tax on these internal dealings. Each year your broker will provide a tax statement with the essential figures to declare on your tax return. No need to crunch the numbers yourself, though understanding the guidelines can be beneficial. For instance, if you've possessed a stock for almost a year, you may want to delay the sale for a few more weeks to profit from a lower tax rate associated with long-term capital gains.\n",

See Weiss Research website, ratings section for a very different perspective on Martin Weiss's work than the websites with which he is now associated. I checked both links provided, and agree with the questioner in every way: These appear to be highly questionable investment research websites. I use such strong terms based on the fact that the website actually uses the distasteful pop-up ploy,  \"Are you SURE you want to leave this site?\" Clearly, something changed between what Weiss Ratings was in the past (per company history since 1971) and what Martin Weiss is doing now. Larry Edelson seems to have been associated exclusively with questionable websites and high pressure investment advice since 2007. From 1996 through the present, he worked as either an employee or contractor of Weiss Research. Let's answer each of your questions.  On June 22, 2006, the Commission instituted settled administrative   proceedings against Weiss Research, Inc., Martin Weiss, and Lawrence   Edelson (collectively, “Respondents”) for violations of the Investment   Advisers Act of 1940 in connection with their operation of an   unregistered investment adviser and the production and distribution of   materially false and misleading marketing materials.

      "Reference Response:  I see that you're invested in a couple bond funds. You do not want to be invested in bonds when the Fed raises rates. When rates climb, the value of bond investments decline, and vice-versa. So that means you should sell bonds before a rate hike, and buy them before a rate drop.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I notice that your investment portfolio includes some bond funds. It's not a good idea to have bonds when the Federal Reserve ups the rates. An increase in rates results in the depreciation of bond investments value, while a decrease has the opposite effect. Therefore, you should consider selling bonds prior to a rate increase, and purchasing them before rates go down.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Another possibility is that a lot of it is bought using borrowed money. Especially if much of your own money is in the stock market, it may be beneficial to take out a loan to buy something compared to selling other assets to raise the same amount of cash. Even going by the likely relatively conservative £200K/year before taxes, you are looking at a very nice house going for perhaps around 3-5 years' worth of pre-tax income. Let's say you have good contacts at the bank and can secure a loan for £500K at 3.5% interest (not at all unreasonable if you make half that before taxes in a single year and purchase something that can be used as collateral for the money borrowed; with a bit of negotiating, I wouldn't be surprised if one could push the interest rate even lower, and stock in a publicly traded company can also trivially be used as collateral). That's less than £1500/month in interest, before any applicable tax effects -- less than 10% of the before-tax income. And like @Victor wrote, I think it's reasonable to say that especially if the company is publicly traded, the CEO makes more than £200K/year. Given an income of £200K/year and assuming 30% taxes on that amount (the marginal tax would likely be higher, and this includes e.g. interest expense deductions), the money left over after taxes and interest payments on a £500K 3.5% debt is still about £10K/month. Even with a pretty rapid amortization schedule and even if the actual tax rate is higher, that leaves quite a bit of money to be socked away in savings and other investments.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  One conceivable scenario is that a significant portion is procured via loans. Especially if much of your personal wealth is tied up in stocks, utilizing credit to make a purchase could be more advantageous than liquidating assets to gather the same sum of money. Even considering a probable modest annual income of £200K pre-tax, we're talking about a rather luxurious home for around 3-5 years' of your gross income. Suppose you have excellent relationships with your bank and can negotiate a £500K loan at a 3.5% interest rate (far from outlandish if your annual pre-tax earnings are half of that and you're acquiring an asset that could serve as collateral for the borrowed funds; with suitable bargaining, it’s plausible that you could even drive the rate down further, and shares in a publicly listed corporation can easily be collateralized as well). The interest alone would be less than £1500 per month, before considering any tax implications - less than 10% of the gross income. Like @Victor pointed out, it's probable that, particularly if the firm is publicly listed, the CEO is earning more than £200K annually. Assuming an annual income of £200K with 30% tax (expected marginal tax would probably be higher, including expenses like interest tax deductions), the take-home pay after settling taxes and the interest from a £500K 3.5% loan would be approximately £10k per month. Even factoring in a swift repayment plan and potentially higher tax rates, there remains a sizeable amount for saving and investment.\n",

Only thing is that you must keep receipts for all the cost that you claim.

If you go above £43,000 or thereabouts, you pay 40% income tax on any income above that threshold, instead of 20%, but your national insurance payments stop.\n",

If you don't, you can sell the option for a higher price than you paid for it.

I am so old that I remember buying gasoline for $0.759 per gallon.  I recently paid $2.759 per gallon.  You claim that your  relative is not getting a very good return.  Some would suggest that, at $2.759 per gallon, I am not getting a very good price on gasoline.  Rates, yields, returns and the price of gas are not what they once were.  It is actually difficult to get a pretty bad return relative to the current market.  I suspect your relative is no longer getting what he used to get but he is getting a fair return. About record keeping.  Your Uncle Sam benefits at your expense when you keep poor records.  There are substantial penalties for failing to report everything.  Most high school graduates can manage one checking account, one savings account, several charge cards and about 20 CDs and stocks at different institutions with little more than the following:  a) a wall calendar b) a shoe box and c) a stack of 3 by 5 cards.  Don't misplace the shoe box.  If you can use a spreadsheet, it is even easier.  Backup your data. There are a several reasons why you shouldn't consolidate all his cash and put it in a single mutual fund account and then put together a mix of investments that work well for him.  - you are doing it backwards 1st put together a mix of investments that work well for him 2nd consolidate the assets.  Your phrasing suggests a general lack of understanding  - most CDs have penalties for early withdrawal.   - while you enjoy managing your 401K in a single online account, your older relative might not be as comfortable with a lack of paper statements (see shoe box above)  Let me tell you a little about my 401K.  x% blue chip, y% small cap, z% bonds, w% foreign stock.  Once a quarter, I change my current contribution to re-balance current value towards my target percentages.  Every 30 months or so, I consider changing my asset allocation.  The allocation considers my age, my spouses age, our childrens ages, my risk tolerance and my intermediate view of the markets.  Your mileage my vary. to recap\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Just as your query was stated in the latter part, so too will my response be. I will provide some context, which aligns with your approach. I recall a time when gasoline only cost $1.759 per gallon. Being of a certain age, I even remember when it was a mere $0.759 per gallon. Of late, I had to shell out $2.759 per gallon. You argue that your relative isn't receiving much profit. Some might propose that, given the current gas price of $2.759 per gallon, I am not exactly getting an excellent deal, either. Whether it's rates, yields, returns, or gas prices, nothing is as it used to be. It's actually quite challenging these days to rack up a less than stellar return in comparison to the current market.

Make a little chart if it helps.  Benefit and Cost.  If you're looking for financial options, you will have to also add more columns to that chart:  Option and Cost. An example is the comment on making connections with rich kids.  Trust fund babies are everywhere in this country.  Did you know any rich kids while growing up?  How were those rich kids you knew of back then... in your school... in your town?  How did they treat you?  Were you ever invited to their parties or gatherings?  Now there's an opportunity for the privilege to pay a lot of money to sit in a classroom next to them?  Even in the early days of American history with merit based millionaires... tycoons who made it rich by the seat of their pants.  At fancy dinner parties and soirees, a new term emerged to put each other again out of reach: old money (the deserving) and new money (uncultured climbers).   That's my bias.  You'll have some of your own.  What is important to YOU has to come through because these days, the price tag of any higher education implies a considerable piece of your life's timeline will be committed to... something.  Make sure you get what you feel is worth that commitment.

As you navigate through these financial proxies, a plan should become progressively clearer. A simple chart can aid your understanding - advantages and disadvantages. And as you delve into choices of a financial nature, you'll need to increase the complexity of that chart with sections for alternatives and their costs. Consider, as an instance, the advice about building alliances with affluent peers – beneficiaries of large inheritances which are ubiquitous in this nation. Did you happen to know any wealthy children during your childhood years? What were they like - those wealthy peers from your school or town? How did they treat you? Were you part of their social events or gatherings? Can you now see a chance to pay a significant sum to be their classroom counterparts? Merit-based wealth has been a part of America from its early days with moguls who, by their own industrious efforts, became wealthy. From the grand dinners and social occasions, a new distinction was formed - old money (meritorious) and new money (lacking sophistication). Those are my prejudices – you're bound to have your own. You need to prioritize what bears significance for you, as nowadays, pursuing higher education comes at a cost not only monetary but in terms of time. Ensure that your commitment aligns with your perceived value. Contemplate what others have advised here, but don't forget to value those choices and weigh them against your willingness to pay.

Before the current financial crisis in the US you could get enormous amounts of credit (2-5 times a person's annual income) and transfer balances to your bank account to collect interest . There were a bunch of ways to the transfer everything from direct deposit to your bank account to a balance transfer check payable to yourself to overpaying another credit card and requesting a refund. Over paying another account sets off a lot of red flags now days but other methods still work. The financial atmosphere has changed a lot and there are very few available cards with no balance transfer fees or capped fees and the interest rates are a lot lower now so it really isn't worth doing.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Surely, it remains viable to perform balance transfers in the way you described, albeit it's a tardy venture, with finding new card issuers for balance transfers becoming increasingly onerous.

Several strategies were open to effect these transfers, encompassing everything from direct bank account deposits to balance transfer checks made out to oneself, as well as overpayment of another credit card and subsequent refund request. Today, however, overcompensation of another account triggers numerous warning signals, despite other tactics remaining viable.

      "Reference Response:  Google is a poor example since it doesn't pay a dividend (and doesn't expect to), so let's use another example with easy numbers. Company X has a stock price of $100, and it pays a quarterly dividend (many companies do). Let's assume X pays a dividend of $4. Dividends are always quoted in annual terms, as is dividend yield. When a company says that they pay \"quarterly dividends,\" it means that the company pays dividends every quarter, or every 3 months.  BUT, if a company has a $4 dividend, you will not receive $4 every quarter per share. You will receive $4/4 = $1 per share, every quarter. So over the course of a fiscal year, or 4 quarters, you'll get $1 + $1 + $1 + $1 = $4 per share, which is the annual dividend.  The dividend yield = annual dividend/stock price. So in this case, company X's div. yield will be $4/$100 * 100 = 4%. It's important to note that this is the annual yield. To get the quarterly yield, you must divide by 4. It's also important to note that the yield fluctuates based on stock price, but the dividend payment stays constant unless the company states an announcement. For a real world example, consider Intel Corp. (TICKER: INTC) http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=INTC The share price is currently $22.05, and the dividend is $0.84. This makes the annual yield = $0.84/$22.05 * 100 = 3.80%. Intel pays a quarterly dividend, so you can expect to receive $0.21 every quarter for every share of Intel that you own. Hope that clears it up!\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Google may not be the best instance to look at because it doesn't distribute dividends (nor does it plan to), so let's consider a more straightforward case. Think of Company X, for example; its stock is valued at $100 and it consistently pays a quarterly dividend (like many firms). Suppose X proposes a $4 dividend. Bear in mind that dividends are always expressed as annual figures, as is dividend yield. So when a corporation mentions \"quarterly dividends\", it infers that it doles out dividends every three months. However, it's crucial to understand that with a $4 dividend, you won’t get $4 per share each quarter. Instead, you’ll earn $1 per share every quarter, totaling $4 per share over a fiscal year or four quarters. This the annual dividend yield, calculated by the ratio of annual dividend to stock price. So for company X, the dividend yield would be ($4/$100) * 100, which equals 4%. It's worth noting this is an annual yield rate. To calculate the quarterly yield, you have to divide this by 4. It's also fundamental to comprehend that while yield may vary depending on the stock price, the dividend payout remains stable unless there's an official announcement. For instance, take Intel Corp. (TICKER: INTC) http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=INTC. The current share price is $22.05 with a $0.84 dividend, giving an annual yield of ($0.84/$22.05) * 100 which is 3.80%. As Intel distributes a quarterly dividend, you can anticipate receiving $0.21 every quarter for each Intel share you possess. I hope this makes the concept clearer!\n",

There are a lot of differences between the example I am going to give and how the stock market actually runs, but the basic concepts are the same. Lets say your friend asks you if he can borrow some money to start up a company, in exchange you will have some ownership in this company. You have essentially just bought yourself some stock. Now as your friend starts to grow, he is doing well, but he needs more cash to buy assets in order to grow the company more. He is forced with an option, either give you some of the profits, or buy these assets sooner. You decide you don't really need the money right now, and think he can do a lot better with spending the money to buy stuff. This is essentially the same as a company electing to not pay dividends, but instead invest into the future. You as a stock holder are fine with it since you know the money is going toward investing in the future. Even if you never get paid a dividend, as a company grows, you can then turn around and sell the stock to someone else for more money then you gave originally. Of course you always take the risk of having the company failing and loosing some if not all of your investment, but that is just the risk of the market.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  You already have a lot of suitable responses, yet I'd like to contribute something that might enhance your understanding of stocks. There's a significant disparity in the analogy I'm going to present and the actual operation of the stock market, but the fundamental principles remain unchanged. Imagine, for instance, your friend borrowing money from you to inaugurate a firm, in return, you'll own a portion of that firm. You've effectively purchased some stock. As your friend's business prospers, their need for additional capital arises to procure assets that can further expand the company. They stand before a choice, either to share the profits with you, or to acquire these assets promptly. You conclude that you don't urgently need the cash, and believe they could utilize the funds more effectively for procurements. This parallels a company's decision to withhold dividends in favor of future investments. You, as the stock owner, are content with this, knowing that the funds are being allocated toward future growth. Even without receiving a dividend, as the company expands, you have the ability to trade your shares to another party for more than your initial investment. However, investing always carries the risk of the venture failing and incurring some or complete loss of your investment - a common market hazard.\n",

What you see is the general statement that ETFs are preferable to most mutual funds, if only for the fact that they are low cost. An index ETF such as SPY (which reflects the S&P 500 index) has a .09% annual expense, vs a mutual fund which average a full percent or more.  sheegaon isn't wrong, I just have a different spin to offer you. Given a long term return of say even 8% (note - this question is not a debate of the long term return, and I purposely chose a low number compared to the long term average, closer to 10%) and the current CD rate of <1%, a 1% hit for the commission on the buy side doesn't bother me. The sell won't occur for a long time, and $8 on a $10K sale is no big deal. I'd not expect you to save $1K/yr in cash/CDs for the years it would take to make that $8 fee look tiny. Not when over time the growth will overshaddow this.  One day you will be in a position where the swings in the market will produce the random increase or decrease to your net worth in the $10s of thousands. Do you know why you won't lose a night's sleep over this? Because when you invested your first $1K, and started to pay attention to the market, you saw how some days had swings of 3 or 4%, and you built up an immunity to the day to day noise. You stayed invested and as you gained wealth, you stuck to the right rebalancing each year, so a market crash which took others down by 30%, only impacted you by 15-20, and you were ready for the next move to the upside. And you also saw that since mutual funds with their 1% fees never beat the index over time, you were happy to say you lagged the S&P by .09%, or 1% over 11 year's time vs those whose funds had some great years, but lost it all in the bad years.  And by the way, right until you are in the 25% bracket, Roth is the way to go. When you are at 25%, that's the time to use pre-tax accounts to get just below the cuttoff.  Last, welcome to SE.    Edit - see sheegaon's answer below. I agree, I missed the cost of the bid/ask spread. Going with the lowest cost (index) funds may make better sense for you.  To clarify, Sheehan points out that ETFs trade like a stock, a commission, and a bid/ask, both add to transaction cost. So, agreeing this is the case, an indexed-based mutual fund can provide the best of possible options. Reflecting the S&P (for example) less a small anual expense, .1% or less.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  ETFs represent an investment category rather than a specific selection. Put differently, there are beneficial and detrimental ETFs. The consensus typically favours ETFs over the majority of mutual funds due to their cost-effectiveness. For instance, an index ETF like SPY (mirroring the S&P 500 index) has a .09% yearly expense in comparison to the mutual fund's average of 1% or above. Sheegaon's observation isn't incorrect; I'm merely offering a different perspective. Should you have a long-term return of around 8% (mind you, this isn't meant for discussion on the long-term return, I intentionally selected a low figure relative to the standard average, which is closer to 10%) and the current CD rate of less than 1%, a 1% commission on the purchase doesn't faze me. The sale isn't happening soon, and a commission of $8 from a $10K sale doesn't phase me. I wouldn't anticipate you storing $1K annually in cash/CDs for the length it would take for the $8 fee to be negligible. Not when the growth over time will eclipse this. Eventually, your financial status will be affected by the unpredictable fluctuations in the market, varying your net worth by tens of thousands. Want to know why you won't lose sleep over this? Because you saw the stock market volatility of 3 or 4% when you made your initial $1K investment. You developed a resistance to the market's daily fluctuations and remained invested as your wealth grew. You adhered to a proper annual rebalancing strategy, so a 30% market crash affected you by 15-20%, readying you for the next upward trend. Moreover, seeing that mutual funds with their 1% fees never overtook the index over time, you were content trailing the S&P by .09% or 1% over an 11-year span, unlike those whose funds had good runs but were wiped out in the tough years. Also, Roth is the preferred choice until you reach the 25% tax bracket. At 25%, it's wiser to utilise pre-tax accounts to stay just under the threshold. Lastly, a warm welcome to SE. Edit - Refer to Sheegaon's response below. I concur that I overlooked the cost of the bid/ask spread. Opting for the least expensive (index) funds could be to your advantage. To elaborate, Sheehan mentioned that ETFs, like stocks, have commissions and bid/asks, both contribute to the transaction cost. Hence, agreeing with this, an indexed mutual fund could be your best bet. It mirrors the S&P (as an example), with a minimal yearly expense of .1% or less.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The fact that some asset (in this case corporate bonds) has positive correlation with some other asset (equity) doesn't mean buying both isn't a good idea.  Unless they are perfectly correlated, the best risk/reward portfolio will include both assets as they will sometimes move in opposite directions and cancel out each other's risk.  So yes, you should buy corporate bonds.  Short-term government bonds are essentially the risk-free asset.  You will want to include that as well if you are very risk averse, otherwise you may not.  Long-term government bonds may be default free but they are not risk free.  They will make money if interest rates fall and lose if interest rates rise.  Because of that risk, they also pay you a premium, albeit a small one, and should be in your portfolio. So yes, a passive portfolio (actually, any reasonable portfolio) should strive to reduce risk by diversifying into all assets that it reasonably can.  If you believe the capital asset pricing model, the weights on portfolio assets should correspond to market weights (more money in bonds than stocks).  Otherwise you will need to choose your weights.  Unfortunately we are not able to estimate the true expected returns of risky assets, so no one can really agree on what the true optimal weights should be.  That's why there are so many rules of thumb and so much disagreement on the subject.  But there is little or no disagreement on the fact that the optimal portfolio does include risky bonds including long-term treasuries. To answer your follow-up question about an \"anchor,\" if by that you mean a risk-free asset then the answer is not really.  Any risk-free asset is paying approximately zero right now.  Some assets with very little risk will earn a very little bit more than short term treasuries, but overall there's nowhere to hide--the time value of money is extremely low at short horizons.  You want expected returns, you must take risk.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Just because one asset (like corporate bonds) shows positive correlation with another asset (equities), it doesn't suggest that purchasing both is unwise. Unless they are flawlessly linked, the most desirable risk/reward portfolio will encompass both assets since they can counterbalance each other's risk by moving in opposite directions. So, acquiring corporate bonds is recommended. Short-term government bonds are basically risk-free. If your risk tolerance is low, you might want to consider including these, but it's not essential if you're not. Despite being default-free, long-term government bonds aren't completely void of risk. They will yield a profit if interest rates decrease and vice versa. They also provide a slight premium because of their inherent risk and should be a part of your portfolio. Consequently, a passive portfolio, or indeed any prudently managed portfolio, should strive for risk reduction through broad asset diversification. If you subscribe to the capital asset pricing model, the asset allocations should reflect market weights (predominantly in bonds than in stocks). If not, you will have to determine your own allocations. Estimating the actual expected returns of high-risk assets is quite challenging, leading to conflicting opinion on the appropriate weight ratios, which explains why there's no consensus on the matter. Nevertheless, there is agreement that an optimal portfolio does consist of risky bonds, including long-term treasuries. As for your query about a potential \"anchor\" or risk-free asset; the chances are slim. Risk-free assets currently offer near-zero returns. Assets with minimal risk may earn slightly more than short term treasuries, but their returns are meager, given that the time value of money is extremely low at short horizons. If you desire potential returns, you have to embrace risk.\n",

So if you formed Nathan, LLC, or otherwise became self employed, you'd still have to file quarterly estimates and make tax payments.  This would cause taxes to be a much more high touch part of your life. However, you should ensure that you're claiming the proper exemptions etc to avoid excessive withholding.\n",

      "Reference Response:  One of the other things you could do to improve your score would be along the lines of what Pete said in his answer, but using the current financial climate to your advantage. I'm not sure what interest rates are available to you in the UK, but I currently have 4 lines of credit aside from my house. One is a credit card I use for every day purchases and like you pay off immediately with every statement. The other three are technically credit cards, however all three were used to make purchases with 0% financing. The one was for a TV I bought that even gave me 5% off if I pay it off within 6 months. That cash has been sitting in my savings since the day I bought it. I'm making regular payments on all three, but not having to pay any interest. My credit score dropped 25 points with the one as it was an elective medical expense (Visian eye surgery), so for the time the balance is near my credit limit. However, that will bounce back up as the balance lowers. My score was also able to take that hit and still be very high. If you don't have 0% (or very close) available, your better bet would be to follow the other suggestions about saving for a sizable down payment, or other every day expenses like a cell phone.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Emulating Pete's advice could help raise your score, but consider also levering the current financial reality in your favor. I can't speak to what interest rates are currently available in the UK, but at present, I maintain four lines of credit, not counting my home mortgage. One of these is a routine use credit card that I pay off promptly with every billing cycle. Although the other three are technically also credit cards, each was utilized for purchasing items with no interest. One of these was for a TV, where a discount of 5% was offered for settling the bill within six months. I've stashed away the cash for it in my savings from the moment I bought it. Periodic old-fashioned payments are being made on all three, with none generating interest. The decision to pay an opt-in medical cost (Visian eye surgery) led to a 25 point fall in my credit score as the standing amount approached my credit limit. However, as that sum reduces, my score will rebound. Despite the initial dip, my score remains commendably high. Should 0% (or a figure close to it) are not accessible to you, the wiser move might be to adhere to alternative advice like saving up for a decent down payment, or for routine expenses, like your mobile phone bill.\n",

When you invest in stock at eToro, you buy a CFD reflecting a bid on the price movement of the underlying stock, however, you do not actually own the stock or hold any rights shareholders have. The counterparty to the CFD is eToro. When you close your position, eToro shall pay you the amount representing the difference between your buy and sell price for each stock.  I suggest you read the following article about CFDs, it explains everything clearly and thoroughly: http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/trade-a-cfd.asp#axzz2G9ZsmX3A As some of the responders have pointed out, and as is mentioned in the article, a broker can potentially misquote the prices of underlying assets in order to manipulate CFDs to their advantage. However, eToro is a highly reputable broker, with over 2 million active accounts, and we guarantee accurate stock quotes.

And of course, CFD trading at eToro has tremendous benefits. Unlike a direct stock investment, eToro allows you to invest as much or as little as you like in your favorite stocks, even if the amount is less than the relevant stock price (i.e. fraction stocks). For example:  if you invest $10 in Microsoft, and on the day of execution eToro’s average aggregated price was $30 after a spread of 0.1%, you will then have a CFD representing 0.33 stocks of Microsoft in your eToro account. In addition, with eToro you can invest in stock in the context of a social trading network, meaning that you can utilize the stock trading expertise of other trader to your advantage by following them, learning their strategies, and even copying their stock investments automatically.

If you have any further questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us through our site: www.etoro.com.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  As many individuals have already highlighted here, a Contract For Difference (CFD) is what you're buying into when you invest in stock through eToro. You are essentially placing a bet on the price changes of the underlying stock - you're not actually acquiring the stock nor assuming any rights that a shareholder would have. The counterparty for the CFD in this case is eToro. Once you liquidate your position, eToro remunerates the value which represents the price disparity between when you bought and sold the stock. I highly recommend going through this exhaustive piece on CFDs, as it gives a lucid explanation: http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/trade-a-cfd.asp#axzz2G9ZsmX3A. As the article and several respondents have highlighted, a brokerage can potentially skew the pricing of underlying assets to benefit their CFD dealings. However, rest assured eToro is a reliable broker, boasting over 2 million active accounts, and we provide accurate stock quotations. We are also subject to stringent regulations imposed by European authorities (Germany, UK, France, etc.) concerning CFD trade. Our duties include maintaining accurate price quotations. eToro provides sizable advantages through its CFD trading. Unlike traditional stock investment, eToro enables you to pour as much or as little capital as you wish into preferred stocks, allowing for fractional investing. For instance, if you invest $10 in Microsoft, and the average price calculated by eToro was $30, after accounting for a spread of 0.1%, you'll hold a CFD for 0.33 stocks of Microsoft. What makes eToro stand out is the feature allowing you to invest while part of a social trading community. This facilitates learning from other traders, adopting their tactics, and auto-copying their stock investments. This means you're not navigating the stock market single-handedly!

      "Reference Response:  Your question is best asked of a tax expert, not random people on the internet. Such an expert will help you ask the right questions.  For example you did not point out the country or state in which you live.  That matters.   First point is that you will not pay tax on 60K, its expensive to transact real estate, so your net proceeds will be closer to 40K.  Also you can probably the deduct the costs of improvements. You implied that you really like this rental property.  If that is the case, why would you sell...ever?  This home could be a central part of your financial independence plan.  So keep it until you die.  IIRC when it passes to your heirs, a new cost basis is formed thereby not passing the tax burden onto them. (Assuming the property is located in the US.)\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  You should ideally direct your queries to a tax specialist rather than seeking answers from unidentified individuals online. Such a specialist will guide you in framing the correct questions. For instance, you didn't specify your residing state or country, which is a crucial aspect. One initial thing to remember is that you won't be taxed on the entire 60K considering the high cost of real estate transactions; your net proceeds will likely fall around 40K. Additionally, it's likely you can deduct the costs of enhancements. It seems as though you have a strong affection for the rental property. Therefore, why consider selling at all? This property could be a significant component of your financial stability plan, making it worth retaining until your demise. As far as I’m aware, a new cost basis is created when the property is bequeathed to your descendants, thereby alleviating them of the tax obligation.

      "Reference Response:  A Roth IRA is simply a tax-sheltered account that you deposit funds into, and then invest however you choose (within the limits of the firm you deposit the funds with). For example, you could open a Roth IRA account with Vanguard.  You could then invest the $3000 by purchasing shares of VOO, which tracks the S&P 500 index and has a very low expense ratio (0.04 as of last time I checked).  Fidelity has a similar option, or Schwab, or whatever brokerage firm you prefer. IRAs are basically just normal investment accounts, except they don't owe taxes until you withdraw them (and Roth don't even owe them then, though you paid taxes on the funds you deposit).  They have some limitations regarding options trading and such, but if you're a novice investor just looking to do basic investments, you'll not notice.   Then, your IRA would go up or down in value as the market went up or down in value. You do have some restrictions on when you can withdraw the funds; Roth IRA has fewer than a normal IRA, as you can withdraw the capital (the amount you deposited) without penalty, but the profits cannot be withdrawn until you're retirement age (I won't put an actual year, as I suspect that actual year will change by the time you're that old; but think 60s). The reason not to invest in an IRA is if you plan on using the money in the near future - even as an \"emergency fund\".  You should have some money that is not invested aggressively, that is in something very safe and very accessible, for your emergency fund; and if you plan to buy a house or whatever with the funds, don't start an IRA.  But if this is truly money you want to save for retirement, that's the best place to start. **Note, this is not investment advice, and you should do your own homework prior to making any investment.  You can lose some or all of the value of your account while investing.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  A Roth IRA is essentially a tax-protected account where money is stored and subsequently utilized for investments of your choice, within the restrictions set by the firm where the money is deposited. For instance, you could establish a Roth IRA account through Vanguard and then invest the $3000 by buying VOO shares, which follow the S&P 500 index and boasts a very low expense ratio (0.04 at the most recent check). Other options include Fidelity, Schwab, or any other brokerage firm of your preference. IRAs are largely standard investment accounts, with the difference that taxes don't become due until withdrawals are made (and even in the case of Roth, they are not due upon withdrawal, although the initial deposited funds have been taxed). They do come with certain limitations, particularly regarding options trading, but this won't affect beginners who are looking to make straightforward investments. The value of your IRA will fluctuate following market trends. Withdrawal restrictions apply; however, Roth IRA is somewhat more flexible allowing you to withdraw the initially deposited amount without penalties, although the gains can only be taken out when you reach retirement age (let's say your 60s, though the precise age might change by the time you retire). Avoid IRAs if you foresee near-future monetary requirements. It is also advised to retain some funds in a safe and easily reachable location for emergencies, and if your plan is to use the money to buy property, for example, then it's best not to go for an IRA. But if you're determined to save this money for retirement, starting with an IRA is an excellent strategy. **Disclaimer: this is not professional investment advice. Always conduct personal research before making any investment decisions, as the value of your account can decrease or even disappear during investing.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I disagree with the selected answer. There's no one rule of thumb and certainly not simple ones like \"20 cents of every dollar if you're 35\". You've made a good start by making a budget of your expected expenses. If you read the Mr. Money Mustache blogpost titled The Shockingly  Simple Math Behind Early Retirement, you will understand that it is usually a mistake to think of your expenses as a fixed percentage of your income. In most cases, it makes more sense to keep your expenses as low as possible, regardless of your actual income.  In the financial independence community, it is a common principle that one typically needs 25-30 times one's annual spending to have enough money to sustain oneself forever off the investment returns that those savings generate (this is based on the assumption of a 7% average annual return, 4% after inflation). So the real answer to your question is this: UPDATE Keats brought to my attention that this formula doesn't work that well when the savings rates are low (20% range). This is because it assumes that money you save earns no returns for the entire period that you are saving. This is obviously not true; investment returns should also count toward your 25-times annual spending goal. For that reason, it's probably better to refer to the blog post that I linked to in the answer above for precise calculations. That's where I got the \"37 years at 20% savings rate\" figure from. Depending on how large and small x and y are, you could have enough saved up to retire in 7 years (at a 75% savings rate), 17 years (at a 50% savings rate), or 37 years! (at the suggested 20% savings rate for 35-year olds). As you go through life, your expenses may increase (eg. starting a family, starting a new business, unexpected health event etc) or decrease (kid wins full scholarship to college). So could your income. However, in general, you should negotiate the highest salary possible (if you are salaried), use the 25x rule, and consider your life and career goals to decide how much you want to save. And stop thinking of expenses as a percentage of income.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I don't concur with the chosen response. There's no universal guideline, especially not simplistic ones like \"save 20 cents of every dollar if you're aged 35\". A good initial step you've taken is calculating your projected expenses. The blog post titled 'The Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement' on the Mr. Money Mustache blog, elucidates the error in considering your expenses as a fixed ratio of your income. The actual efficient plan, in most cases, is to minimise your expenses irrespective of your earnings. The financial freedom community usually abides by a common principle - one needs nearly 25-30 times their yearly expenses to ensure lifelong sustenance only through the returns on those savings (this is based on a predicted 7% average annual return, 4% after factoring in inflation). So, the actual answer to your query is: UPDATE Keats informed me that this formula isn’t as effective with a lower savings rate, say in the 20% range, as it incorrectly assumes no returns on the money saved throughout the saving period. That's clearly incorrect; any returns earned on investments should be factored into the 25-times annual expenses target. Hence, it’s advisable to refer to the specifics in the blog post linked above for accurate computations. It’s from there that I derived the \"37 years if saving at a 20% rate\" figure. Depending on the variables x and y, one might accumulate enough savings to retire in 7 years (at a 75% savings rate), 17 years (at a 50% savings rate) or even 37 years! (at the recommended 20% savings rate for 35-year olds). As you progress through life, your expenses may rise (for instance, when starting a family or facing unexpected medical situations) or fall (if your child bags a full scholarship for college). Your income could fluctuate too. Nonetheless, it’s recommended to seek the highest pay package possible, adhere to the 25x rule, and consider personal and professional aspirations to determine how much you wish to save. Stop viewing expenses as a mere proportion of your income.\n",

As I mentioned in my comment here, she got a checklist each year and provided the info requested. From where I sat, it seemed a clerk entered the info into tax software.  As part of the transition to me helping her, I asked the prior guy (very nice guy, really) for a quick consult. She took the standard deduction, but also showed a nice annual donation. Didn't take advantage of the QCD, donate directly from an IRA (she was over 70-1/2) to save on the tax of this sum. That could have saved her $500.  She was in the 15% bracket, with some room left for a Roth conversion. Converting just enough to 'fill' that bracket each year seemed a decent strategy as it would avoid the 25% rate as her RMDs rose each year and would push her to 25%. To both items the guy suggested that this was not his area, he was not a financial planner. Yes, I understand different expertise.

Like I referenced in my comment here, she complied with an annual checklist and supplied the needed details. To my understanding, it looked as if a staff member simply entered the details into a tax software. As part of shifting the tasks to me, I sought a brief consultation with her previous tax preparer (truly a nice man). She took the standard deduction but had a substantial annual donation. However, she didn't utilize the QCD, or make direct donations from her IRA (given she was beyond 70-1/2) to cut down the taxable amount. This would have saved her $500. Her tax bracket was 15% with some space for a Roth conversion. A reasonable strategy seemed to be, converting just enough to 'fill' the bracket annually to avert the 25% rate as her RMDs increment annually pushing her to the 25% bracket. Regarding both these items, her previous tax preparer replied he was not a financial planner and this was beyond his scope. Now, while I do understand specialization, I couldn't fathom the value he contributed considering the simplicity of her tax return.

An illustration of this would be that there may be upward or downward trends, but the daily volatility (identical ATR) remains consistent. There are strategies designed to incorporate both intraday details and historical volatility. Concerning which is a superior gauge of volatility, it relies on the purpose for which you are employing this measure.\n",

      "Reference Response:  As the name says, its for income earned in a Foreign country. If you have been paying US income tax on this while living in the US, nothing is going to change here. You should be informing yourself on how to avoid double taxation in your new country of residence. Passive income earned abroad (dividends, interest) also do not fall under this exemption.  The purpose of the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion is to make it easy for expats who work abroad to avoid double income taxation without going through the complicated process of applying for tax credits. The US is the only industrial country that taxes its residents regardless of where they reside. That is also why it only goes to about $100,000 a year. If you are a high earner, they want to make it more difficult. Also as a side note, since you are going to be abroad for a year. I will point out that if you have more than $10,000 in foreign accounts at any point in the year you need to declare this in an FBAR form. This is not advertised as well as it should be and carries ridiculous penalties for non-compliance. I can't count the number of times I have heard a US expat say that they were unaware of this.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Essentially, as the title indicates, it pertains to income generated overseas. If you've been settling your U.S. income tax on this while based in America, it's not going to affect anything. It would be helpful if you understand how to avoid double taxation in your newly adopted country of residence. Any interest or dividends accrued from foreign sources are not covered under this exemption. The Foreign Earned Income Exclusion is designed to make life simpler for expatriates working overseas by helping them avert dual income taxation without having to navigate the complex tax credit application process. The U.S. is the sole developed nation that imposes taxes on its citizens irrespective of their location, explaining why the cap is roughly $100,000 per year. In the event you are a high-income earner, it makes things tougher for you. Another important point to note is that, since you'll be overseas for 12 months, any foreign accounts exceeding $10,000 at any point in that year are mandatory for declaration in an FBAR form. Unfortunately, the authorities do not sufficiently publicize this requirement, leading to heavy penalties for non-adherence. Numerous U.S. expats have confessed to not knowing about this obligation.\n",

      "Reference Response:  If you are like most people, your timing is kind of awful.  What I mean by most, is all.  Psychologically we have strong tendencies to buy when the market is high and avoid buying when it is low.  One of the easiest to implement strategies to avoid this is Dollar Cost Averaging.  In most cases you are far better off making small investments regularly. Having said that, you may need to \"save\" a bit in order to make subsequent investments because of minimums.   For me there is also a positive psychological effect of putting money to work sooner and more often.  I find it enjoyable to purchase shares of a mutual fund or stock and the days that I do so are a bit better than the others.   An added benefit to doing regular investing is to have them be automated.  Many wealthy people describe this as a key to success as they can focused on the business of earning money in their chosen profession as opposed to investing money they have already earned.  Additionally the author of I will Teach You to be Rich cites this as a easy, free, and key step in building wealth.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  If you're similar to the majority, your timing for financial decisions might not always be the best, meaning everyone generally. We're predisposed mentally to purchase when market prices are soaring and hesitant when they plummet. A straightforward strategy to counter this behavior is Dollar Cost Averaging. Frequently, you're in a much better position making regular, smaller investments. However, you might have to save slightly more to afford future investments due to minimum requirements. For my part, there's a positive mindset from frequently and quickly putting cash into effect. I derive pleasure from acquiring mutual fund shares or stock, and the days I do that are generally more fulfilling. A bonus to habitual investing is to set it on automation. Numerous affluent individuals attribute this methodology as essential for success as it enables them to concentrate on their primary income source, rather than fretting over money already earned. Moreover, the author of I Will Teach You to Be Rich identifies this as an effortless, costless, and crucial move in the path of amassing wealth.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Hobby expenses are not tax deductible.  Business expenses are, but only if it's a bona fide business.  First they look at profitability: if you reported a net profit (i.e. paid taxes) in your first 3 years, they will believe you rant on Youtube for a living.   Remember, by the time they get around to auditing you, you'll likely be well into, or through, your third year.   There is an exception for farms.  Other than that, if you lose money year after year, you better be able to show that you look, walk and quack like a business; and one with a reasonable business reason for delayed profitability.  For instance Netflix's old business model of mailing DVDs had very high fixed infrastructure expense that took years to turn profitable, but was a very sensible model.  They're fine with that.  Pets.com swandived into oblivion but they earnestly tried. They're fine with that too.  You can't mix all your activities. If you're an electrician specializing in IoT and smart homes, can you deduct a trip to the CES trade show, you bet.  Blackhat conference, arguable.  SES?  No way.  Now if you had a second business of a product-reco site which profited by ads and affiliate links, then SES would be fine to deduct from that business.  But if this second business loses money every year, it's a hobby and not deductible at all.  That person would want separate accounting books for the electrician and webmaster businesses.  That's a basic \"duck test\" of a business vs. a hobby. You need to be able to show how each business gets income and pays expense separate from every other business and your personal life.  It's a best-practice to give each business a separate checking account and checkbook. You don't need to risk tax penalties on a business-larva that may never pupate.  You can amend your taxes up to 3 years after the proper filing date.  I save my expense reciepts for each tax year, and if a business becomes justifiable, I go back and amend past years' tax forms, taking those deductions.  IRS gives me a refund check, with interest!\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Expenses for hobbies are not eligible for tax deductions, while those for legitimate businesses are deductible. However, this is only applicable if the business demonstrates profitability. For example, if you've shown a net income within the first three years of operation and paid your taxes on it, it validates the viability of your business even if it's as peculiar as earning a living off Youtube rants. Keep in mind that by the time your business is audited, it'll probably be in or past its third year of operation. Exceptions apply for farming businesses. If your business continuously operates at a loss, you'll have to convincingly demonstrate its authenticity and a rational justification for its delayed profitability. Netflix's erstwhile DVD delivery model, inspite of its heavy upfront infrastructural costs and delayed profitability, was a feasible model. This is acceptable. So is the situation of Pets.com, which made genuine efforts but eventually collapsed. What's vital is not to conflate all of your professional pursuits. For example, if you're an electrician specializing in smart home technology, your trip to the CES trade show is deductible, while a trip to the Blackhat conference may not be, and one to SES isn't. However, if you manage a secondary business featuring product recommendations and earn from advertisements and affiliate marketing, the SES event travel costs may be claimed as an expense for this second business. But remember, if this second enterprise consistently loses money, it's considered a hobby and thus, it's no longer tax-deductible. A prudent approach would be to maintain individual financial records for each of these businesses. You must be able to provide an account of the income and expenses of each business separately from your personal finances and any other businesses. It's highly recommended to have distinct bank accounts and checkbooks for each business. You wouldn't want to invite tax penalties for a budding business endeavor that may or may not flourish. It's worth noting that tax amendments can be made up to three years from the official tax filing deadline. I keep all my expenditure receipts for every fiscal year. If a business turns out to be viable, I revise the tax forms of previous years and claim those deductions. The IRS then remits a refund, inclusive of interest. This methodology, in essence, is a simple way to differentiate a hobby from a business.\n",

For instance, Prior to the Reagan era, executives avoided buybacks due to fears that   they would be prosecuted for market manipulation. But under SEC Rule   10b-18, adopted in 1982, companies receive a “safe harbor” from market   manipulation liability on stock buybacks if they adhere to four   limitations: not engaging in buybacks at the beginning or end of the   trading day, using a single broker for the trades, purchasing shares   at the prevailing market price, and limiting the volume of buybacks to   25 percent of the average daily trading volume over the previous four   weeks.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Is it safe to invest in a portfolio of dividend stocks yielding 7-9% with the money borrowed at 3-4% from one of these brokerages? Yes and no. It depends on your risk profile! Any investment has its risks of losing your capital, but not investing is a guaranteed risk, as you will be guaranteed to fall behind the rate of inflation. Regarding investing on margin, this can increase your gains but can also increase your loses. Regarding the stock market - when investing in stocks you should not only look at the dividend rate but also the capital gain or loss potential. Remember in regards to investing on margin, if the share price drop too much you can get a margin call no matter how much dividend you are getting. It is no use gaining 9% in dividend yield per year if you are losing 15% or more in capital each year. Also, what is the risk of the dividend rate being cut back or dividends not being paid at all in the future? These are some of the risks you should consider before investing and derive a risk management plan as part of your investment plan before you invest. No investment is totally safe or risk free, but it is less risky than not investing at all, as long as you understand the risks involved and have a risk management plan in place as part of your overall investment plan.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Is putting money into an assortment of stocks that yield a 7-9% dividend from money borrowed at a 3-4% rate from a brokerage considered safe? The answer is both yes and no, mostly dependent on your tolerance for risk. There's always a level of risk to your initial investment, yet the guaranteed risk is in not investing, which ensures a loss to inflation. As far as margin investing goes, it can potentially multiply your earnings, but is just as likely to exacerbate your losses. In the stock market scenario, don't just focus on the dividend rate, but also consider the potential for gains or losses in capital. Keep in mind when investing on margin, a significant drop in share value can trigger a margin call, regardless of the dividends earned. Earnings of 9% in yearly dividends mean nothing if you're suffering a capital loss of 15% or more annually. Further, how likely is it that the dividend rate is decreased or dividends stop coming altogether? These are risks that should factor into your investment decision, and you should have a risk management strategy integrated into your overall investment plan. While no investment is entirely safe or without risks, it's generally less risky than choosing not to invest, provided you comprehend the involved risks and have a suitably planned risk management strategy.\n",

      "Paraphrased Response:  The NYSE 20 Year Plus Treasury Bond Index (AXTWEN) is a multi-security fixed yield index designed to mirror the total returns of the U.S. Treasury bond market with maturities of 20 years or more.

      "Reference Response:  To some extent, I suppose, most people are okay with paying Some taxes. But, as they teach in Intro to Economics, \"Decisions are made on the margin\". Few are honestly expecting to get away with paying no taxes at all. They are instead concerned about how much they spend on taxes, and how effectively. The classic defense of taxes says \"Roads and national defense and education and fire safety are all important.\" This is not really the problem that people have with taxes. People have problems with gigantic ongoing infrastructure boondoggles that cost many times what they were projected to cost (a la Boston's Big Dig) while the city streets aren't properly paved. People don't have big problems with a city-run garbage service; they have problems with the garbagemen who get six-figure salaries plus a guaranteed union-protected job for life and a defined-benefit pension plan which they don't contribute a penny to (and likewise for their health plans). People don't have a big problem with paying for schools; they have a big problem with paying more than twice the national average for schools and still ending up with miserable schools (New Jersey). People have a problem when the government issues bonds, invests the money in the stock market for the public employee pension plan, projects a 10% annual return, contractually guarantees it to the employees, and then puts the taxpayers on the hook when the Dow ends up at 11,000 instead of ~25,000 (California). And people have a problem with the attitude that when they don't pay taxes they're basically stealing that money, or that tax cuts are morally equivalent to a handout, and the insinuation that they're terrible people for trying to keep some of their money from the government.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In a way, I believe, the majority of individuals are somewhat comfortable paying a certain amount of taxes. However, as introductory economics lessons emphasize, \"Choices occur at the edges.\" Very few truly anticipate evading taxes completely. Instead, they're mostly worried about the sizeable chunk their income that goes to taxes, and the value they receive from tax-funded services. The common justification for taxes states, \"Infrastructure, national security, education, and safety measures are crucial.\" But this isn't the real issue that people have with taxes. The main complaints are about monumental ongoing infrastructure projects, like Boston's Big Dig, which overrun their budgets, while their city streets remain in dire need of maintenance. People don't necessarily object to city-run refuse collection; their issue is with those sanitation workers who have large salaries, lifelong job security, and receive pension benefits without making any contributions (and similar scenarios for their healthcare plans). There are not major objections to financing schooling; the issue arises when they have to pay more than twice the national average for education and yet receive substandard results (as in New Jersey). Taxpayers have complaints when the government floats bonds, stakes the money in stock markets for public employee pensions, anticipates a 10% yearly return, assures it to workers, and holds taxpayers liable when the Dow falls short (as seen in California). They also take issue with the notion that avoiding taxes equates to theft, that tax reductions are ethically comparable to handouts, and the insinuation that they are wrong for wanting to retain some of their earnings from the government.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Regarding:   1) What's the point of paying a dividend if the stock price automatically decreases? Don't the shareholders just break even?   As dividends distribution dates and amounts are announced in advance, probably the stock price will rise of the same amount of the divident before the day of distribution. If I know that stock share A's value is y and the dividend announced is x, I would be willing to buy shares of A for anything > y and < than x+y before the distribution.So, arbitrageurs probably would take the price to x+y before the dividend distribution, and then after the dividend distribution the price will fall back to y.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Concerning: 1) Why should one bother with paying dividends when the stock price decreases accordingly, leading shareholders to simply break even? The reality is that given the pre-announced dates and amounts of dividend distributions, the stock price is likely to increase by an equivalent amount before the distribution. If I know the value of stock A is y and the announced dividend is x, I would be open to buying shares in A for any price > y and < than x+y prior to distribution. Thus, arbitrages may push the price to x+y just before the dividend distribution, which will then drop back to y after the distribution.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Buyouts are usually for more than the ORIGINAL value of a stock. That's because the price \"premium\" represents an incentive for holders to \"tender\" their shares to the would-be buyer. Sometimes in these situations, the stock price rises above the proposed buyout price, in anticipation of a higher takeover bid from a SECOND party (that may or may not materialize). To answer the other part of the question, does a bidder have a chance of taking over a dying company for less than the market price? That is a strategy sometimes referred to as a \"take under,\" and it has not been a notably successful strategy. That's because it goes against \"human nature\" (of the seller). \"Where there is life, there is hope.\" They would seldom accept a lower price for \"sure\" survival, when the market is telling them that they are worth a higher price. Very few people realize that the market may disappear tomorrow. Think of all the homeowners who won't cut their price, but insist on bids that meet recent \"comps.\" And if the company is really dying, the prospective buyer may be best served by waiting until it does, and then pick up the individual pieces at auction.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Acquisitions typically value stocks at a higher amount than their original price due to a \"premium\", an inducement for shareholders to offer their stocks to the prospective purchaser. There are instances where the stock price escalates above the offered acquisition price, as stakeholders anticipate a superior takeover proposal from another interested party, which may or may not occur. Addressing the second part of the question, could a proposer takeover a failing company for a price lesser than its market value? This approach, often termed a \"take under\", has not been markedly successful. It goes against the selling party's \"human nature\". The mantra \"While there's life, there's hope\" rings true. It is rare for them to accept a lesser guaranteed survival price when the market indicates their value is higher. Very few comprehend that the market could vanish the next day. Consider homeowners that refuse to decrease their price, insisting on receiving offers that match recent comparable sales. Furthermore, if the firm is truly on the brink of closure, it may be in the best interest of the potential buyer to pause until the company collapses and then buy the individual parts at an auction.\n",

The practical measures to counteract this involve remembering the saying, \"If it seems too good to be true, then likely it is.\" Furthermore, placing investments in fairly large corporations will help since they are subjected to more rigorous audits and hiding fraudulent dealings within them is increasingly difficult (although not unfeasible, as demonstrated by the Enron case).

All EU countries (and some others) have direct deposits and transfers as the standard way of transferring money since about 20 years, and since about 5 years it is cost-free and one-day across all the EU. The rest of the world runs mostly country specific system, as there is not that large a demand for cross country shifting, and exchange rates are also an issue in any such transaction. Because they have different ways that work fine since decades, other countries will consider the eCheck idea as a step backwards and will probably ignore it, so your answer is 'none'. International companies work with banks in a different relationship than retail customers, so they can do things you and me cannot do - depending on size and volume. Some large companies get a banking license and then handle their own stuff; medium sized companies make favorable contracts with banks (they are golden goose customers - never an issue, no brick and mortar presence needed, banks love them), or they simply suck up the transfer cost (if you move millions, who cares about a 40 $ fee).

      "Paraphrased Response:  The U.S. banking system's attempt to modernize includes the introduction of eChecks (and ACH), which may seem behind other countries. For the past two decades, all EU nations (and some others) have used free and efficient direct deposits and transfers as the standard way to shift money, and this cost-free transfer occurs within a day all over the EU from about 5 years ago. Other world locations primarily depend on systems particular to their nations due to reasons like lack of vast demands for cross-country transactions and complicacies regarding exchange rates. Despite the different methods being used efficiently for several years, other nations could perceive the eCheck initiative as regressive and disregard it, leading to the conclusion of 'none' in answer to your question. The way international firms interact with banks varies from the relation of retail clients; therefore, they have capacities that are beyond our reach, contingent on size and volume. Large corporations may become licensed banks themselves to manage their transactions, while mid-size firms may negotiate advantageous agreements with banks, as they are attractive customers without any issues or need for physical existence– an aspect banks are fond of. Alternatively, they might just bear the transfer expenses (pertinently when millions are involved, a 40$ fee isn't much). On the other hand, small businesses typically grumble but accept what's available.\n",

      "Reference Response:  From my own personal experience, you cannot trade spreads in RRSP or TFSA accounts in Canada. You can only buy options (buy a call or buy a put) or you can sell calls against your stock (covered call selling). You will not be able to sell naked options, or trade any type of spread or combo (calendars, condors, etc). I am not sure why these are the rules, but they are at least where I trade those accounts.\n",

Your trading options are limited to purchasing options (acquiring a call or put) or selling calls if you already own the stock (referred to as covered call selling). The ability to sell naked options, or participate in any form of spread or combination trades (like calendars or condors), is not provided.

      "Reference Response:  Although this has been touched upon in comments, I think the following line from the currently accepted answer shows the biggest issue: There is a clear difference between investing and gambling. The reality is that the difference isn't that clear at all. Tens of comments have been written arguing in both directions and looking around the internet entire essays have been written arguing both positions. The underlying emotion that seems to shape this discussion primarily is whether investing (especially in the stock market) is a form of gambling. People who do invest in this way tend to get relatively emotional whenever someone argues that this is a form of gambling, as gambling is considered a negative thing. The simple reality of human communication is that words can be ambiguous, and the way investors will use the words 'investments' and 'gambles' will differ from the way it is used by gamblers, and once again different from the way it's commonly used. What I definitely think is made clear by all the different discussions however is that there is no single distinctive trait that allows us to differentiate investing and gambling. The result of this is that when you take dictionary definitions for both terms you will likely end up including lottery tickets as a valid form of investment.  That still however leaves us with a situation where we have two terms - with a strong overlap - which have a distinctive meaning in communication and the original question whether buying lottery tickets is an investment. Over on investorguide.com there is an absolutely amazing strongly recommended essay which explores countless of different traits in search of a difference between investing and gambling, and they came up with the following two definitions: Investing: \"Any activity in which money is put at risk for the purpose of making a profit, and which is characterized by some or most of the following (in approximately descending order of importance): sufficient research has been conducted; the odds are favorable; the behavior is risk-averse; a systematic approach is being taken; emotions such as greed and fear play no role; the activity is ongoing and done as part of a long-term plan; the activity is not motivated solely by entertainment or compulsion; ownership of something tangible is involved; a net positive economic effect results.\" Gambling: \"Any activity in which money is put at risk for the purpose of making a profit, and which is characterized by some or most of the following (in approximately descending order of importance): little or no research has been conducted; the odds are unfavorable; the behavior is risk-seeking; an unsystematic approach is being taken; emotions such as greed and fear play a role; the activity is a discrete event or series of discrete events not done as part of a long-term plan; the activity is significantly motivated by entertainment or compulsion; ownership of something tangible is not involved; no net economic effect results.\" The very interesting thing about those definitions is that they capture very well the way those terms are used by most people, and they even acknowledge that a lot of 'investors' are gambling, and that a few gamblers are 'investing' (read the essay for more on that). And this fits well with the way those two concepts are understood by the public. So in those definitions normally buying a lottery ticket would indeed not be an investment, but if we take for example Vadim's operation example If you have $1000 and need $2000 by next week or else you can't have an operation and you will die (and you can't find anyone to give you a loan). Your optimal strategy is to gamble your $1000, at the best odds you can get, with a possible outcome of $2000. So even if you only have a 1/3 chance of winning and getting that operation, it's still the right bet if you can't find a better one. this can suddenly change the perception and turn 'gambling' into 'high-risk investing'.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  While previous discussions have touched on the subject, it's been highlighted in the currently approved answer that there is a distinct variance between placing investments and gambling. However, the distinction isn't as straightforward. Numerous comments and extensive online essays argue the similarities and disparities between the two. The primary emotion driving this discussion seems to be the perception of investment (such as in the stock market) as a form of gambling, an idea that tends to evoke strong feelings among many who invest—as gambling is often seen in a negative light. The ambiguity in human language further complicates this, as the semantics of terms like 'investment' and 'gamble' will vary for investors and gamblers, and even more so based on common usage. The conclusion from various discussions indicates there isn't a unique characteristic that can distinguish investment from gambling. As a consequence, official definitions for both words may classify lottery tickets as genuine investments, creating an overlap between both terms with distinct communicative meanings. \n",
      "\n",
      "Investorguide.com provides highly recommended, detailed observations exploring numerous characteristics that differentiate investing from gambling. They define investing as, \"Any activity where money is risked to gain a profit, characterized by sufficient research, favorable odds, risk-averse behavior, systematic approach, no role of emotions such as greed and fear, part of a long-term plan, not solely driven by leisure or compulsion, involves ownership of something tangible, and results in economic gain.\" On the other hand, gambling is defined as, \"Any activity where money is risked to gain profit, characterized by scant or no research, unfavorable odds, risk-seeking behavior, haphazard approach, presence of emotions like greed and fear, discrete or series of events not part of a long-term plan, largely motivated by pleasure and compulsion, lack of tangible ownership, and no economic effect.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "These definitions reflect popular interpretations and acknowledge the overlap between investors who are also gamblers and vice-versa. They resonate with the general public's understanding. Based on these definitions, buying a lottery ticket wouldn't typically be considered as an investment. However, situations with high stakes—a person needing to have a critical operation, for instance—can shift this perception and blur these categories further into what one might call 'high-risk investing'.\n",

      "Reference Response:  There is no zero risk option! There is no safe parking zone for turbulent times! There is no such thing as a zero-risk investment.  You would do well to get this out of your head now.  Cash, though it will retain its principle over time, will always be subject to inflation risk (assuming a positive-inflation environment which, historically in the US anyway, has always been the case since the Great Depression). But I couldn't find a \"Pure Cash - No investment option\" - what I mean by this is an option where my money is kept idle without investing in any kind of financial instrument (stocks, bonds, other MFs, currencies, forex etc etc whatever).  Getting back to the real crux of your question, several other answers have already highlighted that you're looking for a money market fund.  These will likely be as close to cash as you will get in a retirement account for the reasons listed in @KentA's answer. Investing in short-term notes would also be another relatively low-risk alternative to a money market fund.  Again, this is low-risk, not no-risk. I wanted such kinda option because things may turn bad and I may want nothing invested in the stock markets/bond markets. I was thinking that if the market turns bear then I would move everything to cash Unless you have a the innate ability to perfectly time the market, you are better off keeping your investments where they are and riding out the bear market.  Cash does not generate dividends - most funds in a retirement account do.  Sure, you may have a paper loss of principle in a bear market, but this will go away once the market turns bull again.  Assuming you have a fairly long time before you retire, this should not concern you in the slightest. Again, I want to stress that market timing does not work.  Even the professionals, who get paid the big bucks to do this, on average, get it right as often as they get it wrong.  If you had this ability, you would not be asking financial questions on Stack Exchange, I can tell you that. I would recommend you read The Four Pillars of Investing, by William Bernstein.  He has a very no-nonsense approach to investing and retirement that would serve you (or anybody) well in turbulent financial markets.  His discussion on risk is especially applicable to your situation.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  No investment is without its risk, and it's crucial to understand this upfront. Even cash, while maintaining its principal, is susceptible to the risk of inflation, especially in a positive-inflation context which, historically in the U.S, has always been the case post-Great Depression. I've also struggled to find a 'Pure Cash - No investment' scenario, where my money lies dormant without being invested in any sort of financial asset such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, forex, currencies, and the like. As for the main point of your inquiry, responses have already pointed out that a money market fund is what you are seeking. These will be nearly identical to actual cash in a retirement account, for the reasons indicated in @KentA's response. Another low-risk alternative could be investing in short-term notes. Keep in mind, this is low-risk, not risk-free. The reason I desire such an option is due to the potential deterioration of circumstances in which I might not want to contribute anything to the stock/bond markets. If the market turns bearish, my plan is to convert all of my investments into cash. However, it's important to realize that trying to time the market perfectly is nearly impossible, and it's wiser to maintain your investments and weather the bear market. Capital in cash makes no dividend, unlike the majority of retirement account funds. You might experience a loss on paper in a bear market, but It will recover when a bullish market reemerges. As long as your retirement is still a ways off, this shouldn't be worrisome. I must reiterate that Timing the market is an unreliable strategy. Even professionals who spend their lives trading are just as likely to get it wrong as they are to get it right. If you possessed this skill, there'd be no need to ask financial questions here. I suggest looking into The Four Pillars of Investing by William Bernstein. His straightforward strategies for investing and retirement will be beneficial to anyone in a financially turbulent environment. His ideas on risk are particularly relevant to your situation.\n",

      "Reference Response: Reference Response:  (a) you give away your money - gift tax The person who receives the gift doesn't owe any tax.  If you give it out in small amounts, there will be no gift tax. It could have tax and Estate issues for you depending on the size of the gift, the timing, and how much you give away in total.  Of course if you give it away to a charity you could deduct the gift. (b) you loan someone some money - tax free?? It there is a loan, and and you collect interest; you will have to declare that interest as income. The IRS will expect that you charge a reasonable rate, otherwise the interest could be considered a gift. Not sure what a reasonable rate is with savings account earning 0.1% per year. (c) you pay back the debt you owe - tax free ?? tax deductible ?? The borrower can't deduct the interest they pay, unless it is a mortgage on the main home, or a business loan. I will admit that there may be a few other narrow categories of loans that would make it deductible for the borrower. If the loan/gift is for the down payment on a house, the lender for the rest of the mortgage will want to make sure that the gift/loan nature is correctly documented. The need to fully understand the obligations of the homeowner. If it is a loan between family members the IRS may want to see the paperwork surrounding a loan, to make sure it isn't really a gift. They don't look kindly on loans that are never paid back and no interest collected.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  (a) When you distribute your funds as a gift - a gift tax may apply. The recipient of the gift bears no responsibility for this tax. If the funds are disseminated in insignificant portions, you won't accrue a gift tax. Depending on the value of the gift, the timing, and the cumulative amount you give, you may encounter tax and Estate complications. Donating to charities allows for a tax deduction of the gift amount. (b) When you lend money - is it tax-free? If it's a loan and you accrue interest, this interest must be reported as income. The IRS will expect you to enforce a reliable rate; otherwise, they can regard the interest as a gift. The definition of a fair rate is unclear when savings accounts yield a 0.1% annual return. (c) Repayment of your own debt – tax-free or tax-deductible? The debtor cannot write off the interest paid, except if the loan is for their primary residence or business. It's worth noting that there may be additional specific types of loans that might enable the borrower to deduct it. If the loan or gift is intended for a house down payment, the secondary lender will need proper documentation of the loan or gift's nature. They need to be absolutely sure of the homeowner's commitments. When it comes to intrafamily loans, the IRS may need to examine the loan agreement to verify it is not a gift in disguise. The IRS takes a dim view of loans that aren't repaid and where no interest is collected.\n",

      " Sample Numbers: Owe $100k on house.  House (after 'crash') valued at: $50K.  Reason for consternation: What rational person pays $100k for property that is only worth half that amount? True Story: My neighbor paid almost $250K (a quarter-of-a-million dollars - think about that..) for a house that when he walked (ran!) away from it was sold by the bank for $88K.  Unless he declares bankruptcy (and forgoes all his other assets, including retirement savings) he still owes the bank the difference. And even with bankruptcy, he may still owe the bank - this should cause anyone to be a bit concerned about being up-side down in a mortgage loan.\n",

Unless he files for bankruptcy, which might mean parting with all his additional assets like retirement funds, he's still accountable for the deficit to the bank. And startlingly, even in the case of bankruptcy, he might still have some debt with the bank. This reaffirms concerns about the danger of holding a mortgage loan that's underwater.\n",

      "Reference Response:  As indicated in comments, this is common practice in the US as well as EU.  For example, in this Fox Business article, a user had basically the same experience: their card was replaced but without the specific merchant being disclosed.  When the reporter contacted Visa, they were told: \"We also believe that the public interest is best served by quickly notifying financial institutions with the information necessary to protect themselves and their cardholders from fraud losses. Even a slight delay in notification to financial institutions could be costly,” the spokesperson said in an e-mail statement. “Visa works with the breached entity to collect the necessary information and provides payment card issuers with the affected account numbers so they can take steps to protect consumers through independent fraud monitoring, and if needed, reissuing cards. The most critical information needed is the affected accounts, which Visa works to provide as quickly as possible.” What they're not saying, of course, is that it's in Visa's best interests that merchants let Visa know right away when a leak occurs, without having to think about whether it's going to screw that merchant over in the press.  If the merchant has to consider PR, they may not let the networks know in as timely of a fashion - they may at least wait until they've verified the issue in more detail, or even wait until they've found who to pin it on so they don't get blamed. But beyond that, the point is that it's easier for the network (Visa/Mastercard/etc.) to have a system that's just a list of card numbers to submit to the bank for re-issuing; nobody there really cares which merchant was at fault, they just want to re-issue the cards quickly.  Letting you know who's at fault is separate.  There's little reason for the issuing bank to ever know; you should find out from the merchant themselves or from the network (and in my experience, usually the former). Eventually you may well find out - the article suggest that: [T]he situation is common, but there is some good news: consumers do in many cases find out the source of the breach. But of course doesn't go into detail about numbers.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  As highlighted in discussions, this practice is widespread in both the US and EU. To illustrate, a Fox Business article shares a similar case in which a customer had their bank card replaced without revealing the specific merchant involved in the breach. Upon contacting Visa, the journalist received the comment that swift notification to financial institutions serves the public interest best, keeping both the institutions and their clients safe from fraudulent activities. Any delay in providing this crucial information might result in significant losses, the representative said in a digital correspondence. Visa collaborates with the compromised organization to accumulate necessary information, and promptly supplies the relevant account numbers to the card issuers. This allows them to safeguard customers via autonomous fraud monitoring and, if required, card replacement. The most vital data needed is the compromised accounts, which Visa strives to deliver promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is left unsaid, however, is Visa's vested interest in being promptly informed of any breaches by the store concerned, without considering whether it will harm the store's public image. If the store needs to manage its publicity, it might not communicate the breach to the networks right away. They might take their time to fully understand the issue or find a scapegoat to take the blame and avoid negative press. The crux of the matter is that it's more convenient for the network (like Visa/Mastercard), to just maintain a catalogue of card numbers for the bank to replace. No one is overly concerned about the responsible merchant; the objective is to reissue the cards promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The task of informing you about the party responsible for the breach is separate. Ideally, the merchant themselves should provide you with this information or the network should (though usually, it's the former). Over time, you'll likely discover the source of the breach - a common situation. But there is a silver lining; in numerous instances, customers do become aware of the breach's origin.

TD Ameritrade has a list of commission-free ETFs and has no minimum deposit required to open an account. Another idea is to keep gifts in cash until a certain threshold is reached. For instance, $100 for birthday, $100 for Christmas, $100 for next birthday, $100 for next Christmas, now execute the trade. Sharebuilder has $4 scheduled trades, so you'd be at about 1% overhead for that. If other people give money, you'll reach the threshold faster of course. For what it's worth, I do something similar for my 2 nieces. I combined their account and prepay Christmas plus birthday, so I do 1 trade a year. I have my account at Sharebuilder because my idea predated the commission-free ETFs that are now pretty popular. I should really transfer the account... hm.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I intended to remark on the notion of commission-free ETFs, which finds my consensus, but I'm lacking in sufficient reputation. TD Ameritrade presents a catalog of commission-free ETFs and doesn't mandate a minimum deposit to initiate an account. An alternative strategy is holding onto gifts as cash until they accumulate to a specific level. This might entail, for example, $100 on each birthday and Christmas, at which point a trade can be made. Rounded to the nearest amount, Sharebuilder charges $4 for scheduled trades, resulting in about 1% expenditure for that. If others contribute financially, naturally, the set limit will be achieved more swiftly. I apply a relatively similar method for my two nieces.

How much a person pays over spot with gold can be negotiated in person at a coin shop or in an individual transaction, though many shops will refuse to negotiate.

However, in researching your question, I dug for some information on one gold ETF OUNZ - which is physically backed by gold that you can redeem.

After all, redeeming for 50 ounces   of Gold Eagles would result in a $3,000 fee on a $65,000 transaction.   That's 4.6 percent!

      "While trying to answer your question, I managed to unearth some details about the gold ETF OUNZ. This ETF is backed by physical gold that you can claim. It appears that if you exchange your shares for physical gold, you only cover the spot price. But you might wonder, aren't those charges excessively high? To put it in perspective, if you were to redeem for 50 ounces of Gold Eagles, it would lead to a charge of $3,000 on a transaction of $65,000, which accounts for 4.6 percent! This fee, in actuality, just mirrors the convenience premium that gold coins garner in the market. Let's compare these exchange fees to the premiums charged by two leading online gold retailers over spot. \n",

      "Reference Response:  The short answer is: it depends. The longer answer is that balance transfers are tricky, and often a bait-and-switch; they'll offer 0% interest, but charge a 3-4% \"fee\" (which isn't interest and is perfectly legal) on the amount transferred. If you transfer $5000, you now owe the new card company $5,200. Now, that could be fine with you; at an 18-20% APR on your old card you may have been charged that much in just one or two months, and by capitalizing this fee up front you lock in 0% for a year. However, there are other possible machinations behind the scenes. For instance, you may incur retroactive interest on the full balance if not paid off in the year (at 20% APR on $5000, that's an extra grand you will owe if there's even one dollar of the original transferred balance left in the account). Paying off the balance and thus avoiding these penalties has actually been made harder by the CARD Act, which required creditors to apply any payment made to the highest-interest portion of the balance first. As balance transfers are 0% they are the last on the list, so if you transfer a balance and then carry an additional balance you are setting yourself up for failure. You MUST have a zero-dollar balance for one month sometime during the year in order to be sure the balance transfer is paid off and no penalties will be incurred. That can be hard, because 5 grand is a lot to pay off. To pay off a $5000 balance in 12 months requires payments of $417. Miss one and you'll have to make it up over the remaining months. If you transferred a balance, you probably didn't have $420/mo to pay to the card in the first place. In summary, balance transfers can work, but you have to understand all of the terms and conditions, and what will happen should you violate any of them. If you don't understand what you're getting into, you could very well end up worse than you started.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In a nutshell, the answer can vary. A more comprehensive explanation would be that balance transfers can be quite complicated and are often used as a deceptive lure. These usually come with a 0% interest promise, however, a 3-4% \"fee\" (which isn't considered as interest and is completely legal) on the transferred sum is added. For instance, if you transfer $5000, you'll end up owing the new credit card company $5,200. This might seem acceptable considering the 18-20% APR on your previous card, which could have resulted in similar charges within a couple of months. Plus, by paying this fee outright, you secure a 0% rate for a year. But there might be multiple hidden implications. One such issue is that you could be charged retroactive interest on the complete balance if it's not fully paid within a year (20% APR on $5000, meaning an additional thousand dollars owed if even a single dollar of the original transferred balance remains). Because of the CARD Act, paying the balance and avoiding these penalties is more difficult since it mandates creditors to apply any payment made to the highest-interest portion of the balance before anything else. So, balance transfers being 0%, are last on the list, and if you carry an additional balance after the transfer, you're possibly paving your path towards failure. You must ensure a zero balance for at least once during the year to guarantee that the balance transfer is fully paid and no penalties will arise. This might be tough as $5000 is not a small amount to pay off. To settle a $5000 balance in a year, monthly payments of $417 are required. Failure to make one payment means catching up over the subsequent months. If you're in a situation to transfer a balance, you probably didn't have an extra $420 per month to pay the credit card in the first place. In conclusion, balance transfers can be advantageous but require a clear understanding of all terms and conditions and the potential consequences of violating them. If you're unclear about the deal, it could lead to an even worse financial situation than before.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Recently, I asked about what the company valuation is and how many   shares does my 4% represent.CFO told me that there is no point to talk   about \"shares\" or \"stock\" since the company is not public. Is it   right? No, it is wrong. Shares and stocks exist regardless of how they can be traded. Once a company is formed, there are stocks that belong to the owners in the proportion of the ownership. They may not exist physically, but they do exist on paper. As an owner of 5% of the company, you own 5% of the company stocks. I asked if my investor portion equity will be subjected under a   vesting schedule, CFO said yes. That doesn't make sense to me, because   I bought those 4%? Aren't those supposed to be fully vested? I agree   to my employee equity to be vested. Doesn't make sense to me either, since your money is already in their pocket. But I'm not sure if its illegal. If that's what is written in the signed contract - then may be its possible to have that situation. But it doesn't make much sense, because these shares are granted to you in return to your money, not some potential future work (as the 1% employee's portion). You already gave the money, so why wouldn't they be vested? Best to read the contract upon which you gave them your money, I really hope you have at least that and not just gave them a check....\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I recently inquired about the company's valuation and how many shares my 4% equity equates to. The CFO told me that talking about \"shares\" or \"stock\" was pointless since the company was not publicly traded. Was he correct? Not at all. Shares and stocks exist no matter their tradeability status. Upon a company's formation, stocks pertaining to the owners' ratios of ownership are established. Although these may not physically manifest, they are indeed existent on paper, meaning if you own 5% of the company, then you own 5% of the business' stocks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I asked if my investor equity would be subject to a vesting schedule, which the CFO confirmed. This confused me, as I purchased the 4% equity. Shouldn't these equities be fully vested? I can understand if my employee equity was vested, but this doesn't seem right, especially since the company already has my money. While unsure of the legality, if such conditions were specified in the contract, it might be possible. It's certainly unusual, as these shares were given to you in return for your investment, not for future work as it is the case with an employee's share. Given that you've already invested the money, there's no clear reason why they wouldn't be vested. Just to be safe, it'd be best to go through the contract under which you made your investment. Hopefully, you didn't just write them a check without any supporting documentation...\n",

      "Reference Response:  An option, by definition, is a guess about the future value of the stock. If you guess too aggressively, you lose the purchase price of the option; if you guess too conservatively, you may not take the option or may not gain as much as you might have. You need to figure out what you expect to happen, and how confident you are about it, against the cost of taking the option -- and be reasonably confident that the change in the stock's value will be at least large enough to cover the cost of buying into the game. Opinion: Unless you're comfortable with expectation values and bell curves around them, it's significantly easier to lose money on options than to profit on them. And I'm not convinced that even statisticians can really do this well. I've always been told that the best use for options is hedging an investment you've already made; treating them as your primary bet is gambling, not investment.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Essentially, an option is a prediction about a stock's future worth. If your prediction is overly ambitious, you risk losing the amount you used to buy the option. Conversely, an overly cautious prediction might dissuade you from taking the option or restrict your potential earnings. You must weigh your expectations and level of confidence against the cost of pursuing the option, ensuring you have a reasonable assurance that the fluctuation in the stock's value will sufficiently cover the buying cost. Aside: If you are not adept in managing expectations and navigating the statistical averages that surround them, the likelihood of incurring losses through options is significantly larger than that of gaining profits. Even for professionals well-versed in statistics, this is a challenging feat. It's often advised that the optimal utilization for options is to secure an existing investment, making it a risky proposition to consider it as the main bet, which equates more to gambling than wisely investing.\n",

      "Reference Response:  DCA is not 10%/day over 10 days. If I read the objective correctly, I'd suggest about a 5 year plan. It's difficult to avoid the issue of market timing. And any observation I'd make about the relative valuation of the market would be opinion. By this I mean, some are saying that PE/10 which Nobel prize winner Robert Schiller made well known, if not popular, shows we are pretty high. Others are suggesting the current PE is appropriate given the near zero rate of borrowing.  Your income puts long term gains at zero under current tax code. Short term are at your marginal rate.  I would caution not to let the tax tail wag the investing dog. The fellow that makes too many buy/sell decisions based on his taxes is likely to lag he who followed his overall allocation goals.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The concept that DCA provides a 10% return per day over a span of 10 days is not accurate, assuming I've understood the goal correctly. I'd propose a strategic approach spanning five years. Market timing is one issue that's hard to sidestep. Any conclusions I draw about the market's relative worth would merely be subjective. For instance, some people are pointing to the PE/10 indicator, made prominent by Nobel laureate Robert Shiller, as proof that the market is somewhat overvalued. On the other hand, some argue that the current PE ratio is justified in light of the almost null borrowing rate. Your earnings are subject to zero long-term gains tax under the existing tax system, while short-term gains are taxed at your marginal rate. I'd advise not letting tax considerations dominate your investment decisions - an investor who excessively bases buying and selling decisions on tax matters is likely to underperform someone who sticks to their overall investment objectives.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Normally, you don't pay capital gains tax until you actually realize a capital gain.  However, there are some exceptions. The exception that affected Eduardo Saverin is the expatriation tax, or exit tax.  If you leave a country and are no longer a tax resident, your former country taxes you on your unrealized capital gains from the period that you were a tax resident of that country.  There are several countries that have an expatriation tax, including the United States.  Saverin left the U.S. before the Facebook IPO. Saverin was perhaps already planning on leaving the U.S. (he is originally from Brazil and has investments in Asia), so leaving before the IPO limited the amount of capital gains tax he had to pay upon his exit.  (Source: Wall Street Journal: So How Much Did He Really Save?) Another situation that might be considered an exception and affects a lot of us is capital gain distributions inside a mutual fund.  When mutual fund managers sell investments inside the fund and realize gains, they have to distribute those gains among all the mutual fund investors.  This often takes the form of additional shares of the mutual fund that you are given, and you have to pay capital gains tax on these distributions.  As a result, you can invest in a mutual fund, leave your money there and not sell, but have to pay capital gains tax anyway.  In fact, you could owe capital gains tax on the distributions even if the value of your mutual fund investment has gone down.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Typically, a capital gains tax is only applicable when you actually make a capital gain, but there are certain exceptions to this rule. One such exception that impacted Eduardo Saverin is known as the expatriation tax or the departure tax. Should you decide to exit a country and subsequently sever your tax residency, you would still be mandated to pay taxes on your unrealized capital gains accrued during your time as a tax resident. Several nations, such as the United States, enforce this form of taxation. Saverin, originally from Brazil with investments in Asia, anticipated this and chose to vacate the U.S. prior to the Facebook IPO to mitigate his exit tax liability. (Source: Wall Street Journal: So How Much Did He Really Save?) An alternate scenario that can also be viewed as an exception, impacting a number of people, occurs within a mutual fund when managers distribute capital gain after selling investments within the fund. This distribution often happens in the form of extra fund shares given to you, and it's likely that you will need to pay tax on these shares. Consequently, even if you invest in a mutual fund and refrain from selling, you could still be subjected to capital gains tax. It is even possible to be liable for this tax even if the value of your mutual fund investment decreases over time.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The same applies if you were looking for a business to buy: would you pay more for a business that is doing well making increasing profits year after year, or for a business that is not doing so well and is losing money. A share in a company is basically a small part of a company which a shareholder can own. So would you rather own a part of a company that is increasing profits year after year or one that is continuously losing money? Someone would buy shares in a company in order to make a better return than they could make elsewhere. They can make a profit through two ways: first, a share of the company's profits through dividends, and second capital gains from the price of the shares going up. Why does the price of the shares go up over the long term when a company does well and increases profits? Because when a company increases profits they are making more and more money which increases the net worth of the company. More investors would prefer to buy shares in a company that makes increasing profits because this will increase the net worth of the company, and in turn will drive the share price higher over the long term. A company's increase in profits creates higher demand for the company's shares. Think about it, if interest rates are so low like they are now, where it is hard to get a return higher than inflation, why wouldn't investors then search for higher returns in good performing companies in the stock market? More investors' and traders' wanting some of the pie, creates higher demand for good performing stocks driving the share price higher. The demand for these companies is there primarily because the companies are increasing their profits and net worth, so over the long term the share price will increase in-line with the net worth. Over the short to medium term other factors can also affect the share price, sometime opposite to how the company is actually performing; however this is a whole different answer to a whole different question.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The principle is the same if you're in the market for a business: would you shell out more for an entity that consistently records escalating profits, or one that is underperforming and incurring losses? Owning a company's shares is essentially possessing a fraction of that business. So, would you prefer to hold a segment of a flourishing company or a continuously unprofitable one? People purchase company shares aiming for an enhanced return than what's available elsewhere. Profits can be acquired in a couple of ways: firstly, via a portion of the company's profits in the form of dividends; secondly, through capital gains as share prices climb. But why do share prices rise over time when a business is thriving and boosting profits? It's because the company is generating increasing revenue, which adds to the net value of the business. Many investors gravitate towards companies that consistently boost profits since this elevates the company's net worth and consequently propels share prices upwards in the long run. A surge in a company's profits triggers a higher demand for its shares. Think about it, in circumstances where interest rates are as low as they are currently, making it challenging to earn returns above inflation, wouldn't it make sense for investors to seek higher returns in well-performing stock market companies? The increased desire from investors and traders for a piece of the action sparks higher demand for top-performing stocks, pushing the share price upwards. The demand for these companies principally arises because the firms are augmenting their profits and net worth, leading to a share price increase over time in parallel with the net worth. In the short to medium term, other elements can also influence the share price, sometimes contrary to the company's actual performance; however, this leads to an entirely different discussion for a completely different question.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Look at your options with a 529 program. If the money is used for education expenses: that currently includes tuition, room & board (even if living off campus), books, transportation; it grows tax free. Earnings are not subject to federal tax and generally not subject to   state tax when used for the qualified education expenses of the   designated beneficiary, such as tuition, fees, books, as well as room   and board. Contributions to a 529 plan, however, are not deductible. If it is a 529 associated with your state you can also save on state taxes. You can make contributions on a regular basis, or ad hoc. Accounts can even be setup by other relatives. I have used a 529 to fund two kids education. It takes care of most of your education expenses.  529 programs are available from most states, and even some of the big mutual fund companies. Many have the option of shifting the risk level of the investments to be more conservative as the kids hit high school.  Some states have an option to have you pay  a large sum when the child is small to buy semesters of college. The deal is worth considering if you know they will be going to a state school, the deal is less good if they will go out of state or to a private college.  The IRS does limit the maximum amount that you can contribute in a year an amount that exceeds the 14,000 annual gift limit: If in 2014, you contributed more than $14,000 to a Qualified Tuition   Plan (QTP) on behalf of any one person, you may elect to treat up to   $70,000 of the contribution for that person as if you had made it   ratably over a 5-year period. The election allows you to apply the   annual exclusion to a portion of the contribution in each of the 5   years, beginning in 2014. You can make this election for as many   separate people as you made QTP contributions One option at the end is to take any extra money at graduation and give it to the child so that it can be used for graduate school, or if the taxes and penalties are paid it can be used for that first car. It can even be rolled over to another relative.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Consider the benefits offered by a 529 plan. Its function is primarily for covering education-related costs such as tuition, books, and room & board (including off-campus living), along with commute expenses, and it enjoys tax-free growth. The earnings, typically free from federal and in most cases state taxes, can be spent on qualified education expenses like tuition, fees, books, and accommodation. However, contributions to a 529 plan are not tax deductible. For plans tied to your state, further tax savings can be achieved. Either regular or irregular contributions can be made, and accounts can be opened by any relative. My own experience with a 529 plan funding two children's educations has been most beneficial in taking care of most education costs. Most states, along with many large mutual fund firms offer 529 plans. Options often include reducing investment risk as your kids approach their high school years. Some states even let you prepay large amounts for future college semesters when your child is still young. This might be a good option if you're certain your child will attend a state school, though the value diminishes if they go out-of-state or to a private college. Keep in mind that the IRS limits your yearly contributions beyond a $14,000 annual gift limit. If your 2014 contributions exceeded this limit, you could allocate up to $70,000 of it over a 5-year period. This lets you use the annual exclusion partly for each of the 5 years, beginning in 2014. You are free to follow this strategy for as many individuals as you have made QTP contributions for. Finally, one available option is to use any leftover money at graduation for further education or, after paying taxes and penalties, it can be put towards a first car. It's even transferrable to another relative.\n",

      "Paraphrased Response:  Aside from the accumulated interest, which is significant, one individual has a balance of $40,000 in their account while the other has $9,000. Is the person who has a higher balance now taxed more, or is the tax the same since their income is equal? In the case of interest-bearing accounts, indeed the person with the $40K account would owe slightly more income tax than the person with the $9K one. If we assume an annual interest rate of 1% and that the balances have remained steady for a year, the larger account would generate interest of $401.84, while the smaller account would yield $90.41.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Here is a quick and dirty explanation of options. In a nutshell, you pay a certain amount to buy a contract that gives you the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at a predetermined price at some date in the future. They come in a few flavors:  I'll give you $100 if you let me buy 10,000 shares of XYZ for $10 more   per share than it is trading at today any time before   August 10th. I'll give you $100 if you promise to buy 10,000 shares of XYZ from me   for $10 less per share than it is trading at today if I ask before August 10th. There are also two main types based on the expiration behavior:  There are lots of strategies that employ options, too many to go into.  Two key uses are.. Leverage: Buying Call options can give you a much higher return on your investment than just investing in the actual stock. However, with much higher risk of losing all of your investment instead of just some of it when the stock drops. Hedging: If you already own the underlying stock, put options can be used to buy down risk of serious drops in a holding.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Here's a basic breakdown of what options are. Essentially, you purchase a contract for a set price, providing you with the privilege, albeit not mandatory, to either buy or sell shares at a pre-agreed price at a future date. These contracts exist in various forms. For instance, you could opt to give me $100 to secure the option to purchase 10,000 shares of XYZ for $10 more per share than its current market value, anytime before August 10th. Conversely, with your $100, you could get a promise from me to sell you 10,000 shares of XYZ for $10 less per share than the current market price by August 10th if I choose to do so. Options also differ according to how they expire. \n",
      "\n",
      "Several strategies can be employed in the use of options, though detailed discussion is beyond our current scope. However, two of their prominent uses are worthy of note. Leverage is one: by buying Call options, you could potentially realize significantly higher returns on your investment compared to directly acquiring the actual stocks. Be aware, though, this strategy implies a greater risk of losing your entire investment, as opposed to only part of it if the stock's value falls. \n",

      "Reference Response:  Everyone else seems to have focused (rightly so) on the negatives of credit cards (high interest rates) and why it is important to pay them off before interest starts accruing. Only Marin's answer briefly touched on rewards.  To me, this is the real purpose of credit cards in today's age.  Most good rewards cards can get you anywhere from 1-2% cash back on ALL purchases, and sometimes more on other categories.  Again, assuming you can pay the balance in full each month, and you are good at budgeting money, using a credit card is an easy way to basically discount 1-2% of all of the spending you put on your card.  AGAIN - this only works to your advantage if you pay off the credit card in full; using the above example of 20% interest, that's about 1.6% interest if the interest compounds monthly, which wipes out your return on rewards if you just go one month without paying off the balance.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Most people understandably concentrate on the downsides of using credit cards, particularly the high interest rates, and emphasize the significance of clearing the balance before interest accrues. Only Marin's response casually mentioned the benefits, which, in my opinion, is the true value of credit cards in the modern world. The majority of reputable rewards cards offer 1-2% cash back on all transactions, and occasionally even more on specified categories. If you are disciplined enough to pay off the whole sum monthly and manage your money well, employing a credit card is a simple method to essentially reduce your spending by 1-2%. But, this is only a financial gain if you clear the full credit card amount; using a 20% interest rate as an example, that roughly amounts to 1.6% interest if the interest is compounded monthly, nullifying the benefits of rewards if you miss a single month's full payment.\n",

Some are dedicated to office buildings, residential letting, mortgages, or a mix of various real estate types. Notably, there are specific REITs that deal solely with hotels.

(FWIW, these are all things that pertain to government student loans in the US, not necessarily private student loans, and not necessarily student loans from other countries) So that's my reasoning. $55 per month for the rest of my life adds up to a large amount of money over the course of my life, but the impact month-to-month is essentially nonexistent. That combined with the low interest and the super-low-pressure-sales-tactics means I just literally don't have any incentive to ever pay it all off. Like I said before, I'm just a guy who has student loans, and not even one who is particularly good with money, but as someone who does choose not to pay off my student loans any faster than I have to, this is why.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  While I might not be a financial expert, I am indeed someone with student debts that I opt to pay off at the slowest rate feasible, and I'll elaborate on my logic for doing so. To clarify, this relates primarily to government student loans in the US and may not extend to private student loans or those in different countries. My rationale lies in the fact that $55 every month for my lifetime accumulates to a significant sum over time, yet its monthly impact is virtually negligible. Combine this with the minimal interest rates and the complete lack of any pressure to pay up quickly, and it becomes clear that there's simply no incentive for me to hasten the repayment process. As I've mentioned earlier, despite being a person with student debts who's not particularly financially savvy, I've chosen a slower repayment strategy, and this is my thought process behind it.\n",

If you know the current price, an options strike price, time until expiration, and risk-free interest rate, then knowing the market price of the option will tell you what the market's estimation of the volatility is. This does rely on a few assumptions, such as Gaussian random walk, but those are reasonable assumptions for most stocks. You can also get a list of past stock prices, put them in Excel, and ask Excel to calculate the standard deviation with stdev.s(), but that gives you the past volatility. The market's estimate of future volatility is more relevant.\n",

This approach involves understanding certain elements such as the present market price, the strike price of the option, the time frame until the option expires and the risk-free interest rate. Once you know these, and the market price of the option, it's possible to gauge the market's anticipated volatility. Granted, this does hinge on a few premises, like the Gaussian random walk, but these are generally acceptable premises for the majority of stocks. Furthermore, by gathering a list of historic stock prices and inputting them into Excel, you could use the stdev.s() function to compute the standard deviation, although this will only show you the past volatility.

      "Reference Response:  A \"market maker\" is someone that is contractually bound, by the exchange, to provide both bid and ask prices for a given volume (e.g. 5000 shares). A single market maker usually covers many stocks, and a single stock is usually covered by many market makers. The NYSE has \"specialists\" that are market makers that also performed a few other roles in the management of trading for a stock, and usually a single issue on the NYSE is covered by only one market maker.  Market makers are often middlemen between brokers (ignoring stuff like dark pools, and the fact that brokers will often trade stocks internally among their own clients before going to the exchange).  Historically, the market makers gave up buy/sell discretion in exchange for being the \"go-to guys\" for anyone wanting to trade in that stock. When you told your broker to buy a stock for you, he didn't hook you up with another retail investor; he went to the market maker. Market makers would also sometimes find investors willing to step in when more liquidity was needed for a security. They were like other floor traders; they hung out on the exchange floors and interacted with traders to buy and sell stocks. Traders came to them when they wanted to buy one of the specialist's issues. There was no public order book; just ticker tape and a quote. It was up to the market maker to maintain that order book.  Since they are effectively forbidden from being one-sided traders in a security, their profit comes from the bid-ask spread. Being the counter-party to almost every trade, they'd make profit from always selling above where they were buying. (Except when the price moved quickly -- the downside to this arrangement.) \"The spread goes to the market maker\" is just stating that the profit implicit in the spread gets consumed by the market maker. With the switch to ECNs, the role of the market maker has changed. For example, ForEx trading firms tend to act as market makers to their customers. On ECNs, the invisible, anonymous guy at the other end of most trades is often a market maker, still performing his traditional role. Yet brokers can interact directly with each other now, rather than relying on the market maker's book. With modern online investing and public order books, retail investors might even be trading directly with each other. Market makers are still out there; in part, they perform a service sold by an Exchange to the companies that choose to be listed on that exchange. That service has changed to helping tamp volatility during normal high-volatility periods (such as at open and close).\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  A \"market maker\" is an entity that is obligated by a trading exchange to offer both purchase and sale prices for a particular volume, for instance, 5000 shares. Generally, a market maker is responsible for numerous stocks, and numerous market makers often oversee a single stock. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) employs \"specialists,\" who are market makers that also undertake additional responsibilities in governing a stock's trading. It's typical for a single issue on the NYSE to have only one market maker. Market makers often serve as intermediaries between brokers, not considering elements like dark pools or the practice of brokers trading stocks internally among their clients before approaching the exchange. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, market makers relinquished the choice to buy or sell in return for becoming the primary point of contact for anyone interested in trading in that stock. If you directed your broker to purchase stock on your behalf, the broker would not connect you to another retail investor but would go to the market maker instead. Sometimes market makers would locate investors ready to intervene when a security required more liquidity. Similar to other floor traders, they spent their time on the exchange floors, interacting with traders to buy and sell stocks. Any trader interested in buying an issue of one of the specialists would approach them. There was no public order book, just a ticker tape and a quote, and it was the market maker's responsibility to keep the order book. \n",

      "Market makers are legally prohibited from trading on one side in a security, so their profit comes from the difference between the buying and selling prices. They generate earnings by always selling at prices higher than what they buy (except when prices shift quickly, leading to losses in this setup). To state that \"the spread goes to the market maker\" is to say that the market maker absorbs the profit inherent in the spread. \n",

In this case there is no market risk as you are just swapping funds (hopefully to ones that you feel will better track the underlying asset classes).  If you are also changing your asset class mixture, then it depends on how large the change is. I would still do the whole change at once. But if you are worried about fluctuations then you could slowly rebalance into your final position by taking a couple of intermediary steps. I would still change all of the fund first but maybe in a mix closer to your current asset mix and then over the next couple of months adjust the ratios to reach your final desired asset mix.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The initial action I recommend is to analyze the current composition of your portfolio's asset classes and compare it to the projected composition of the new portfolio. If they match identically and the only alteration is the investment funds utilized for that particular distribution of asset classes, proceed to make that change all at once. In this scenario, market risk is non-existent as you are simply trading funds (presumably for those you believe will more accurately reflect the inherent asset classes). If there's a shift in your class mix, it will come down to the extent of that change. I'd still suggest implementing the complete change all at once. However, if you're concerned about potential volatility, you could consider gradually adjusting by including a few transitional steps. I'd still advocate for changing the entirety of the fund first, potentially with a balance more akin to your current assets, and then tweak the proportions over the coming months to hit your ultimate desired asset ratio.\n",

Following this, the shares cease to be traded on the exchange.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I can think of a few simple and quick techniques for timing the market over the long term, and they can be used individually or in combination with each other. There are also some additional techniques to give early warning of possible turns in the market. The first is using a Moving Average (MA) as an indication of when to sell. Simply if the price closes below the MA it is time to sell. Obviously if the period you are looking at is long term you would probably use a weekly or even monthly chart and use a relatively large period MA such as a 50 week or 100 week moving average. The longer the period the more the MA will lag behind the price but the less false signals and whipsawing there will be. As we are looking long term (5 years +) I would use a weekly chart with a 100 week Exponential MA. The second technique is using a Rate Of Change (ROC) Indicator, which is a momentum indicator. The idea for timing the markets in the long term is to buy when the indicator crosses above the zero line and sell when it crosses below the zero line. For long term investing I would use a 13 week EMA of the 52 week ROC (the EMA smooths out the ROC indicator to reduce the chance of false signals). The beauty of these two indicators is they can be used effectively together. Below are examples of using these two indicators in combination on the S&P500 and the Australian S&P ASX200 over the past 20 years.  S&P500 1995 to 2015  ASX200 1995 to 2015 If I was investing in an ETF tracking one of these indexes I would use these two indicators together by using the MA as an early warning system and maybe tighten any stop losses I have so that if the market takes a sudden turn downward the majority of my profits would be protected. I would then use the ROC Indicator to sell out completely out of the ETF when it crosses below zero or to buy back in when the ROC moves back above zero. As you can see in both charts the two indicators would have kept you out of the market during the worst of the downfalls in 2000 and 2008 for the S&P500 and 2008 for the ASX200. If there is a false signal that gets you out of the market you can quite easily get back in if the indicator goes back above zero. Using these indicators you would have gotten into the market 3 times and out of it twice for the S&P500 over a 20 year period. For the ASX200 you would have gone in 6 times and out 5 times, also over a 20 year period. For individual shares I would use the ROC indicator over the main index the shares belong to, to give an indication of when to be buying individual stocks and when to tighten stop losses and stay on the sidelines. My philosophy is to buy rising stocks in a rising market and sell falling stocks in a falling market. So if the ROC indicator is above zero I would be looking to buy fundamentally healthy stocks that are up-trending and place a 20% trailing stop loss on them. If I get stopped out of one stock then I would look to replace it with another as long as the ROC is still above zero. If the ROC indicator crosses below zero I would tighten my trailing stop losses to 5% and not buy any new stocks once I get stopped out. Some additional indicators I would use for individual stock would be trend lines and using the MACD as a momentum indicator. These two indicators can give you further early warning that the stock may be about to reverse from its current trend, so you can tighten your stop loss even if the ROC is still above zero. Here is an example chart to explain:  GEM.AX 3 Year Weekly Chart Basically if the price closes below the trend line it may be time to close out the position or at the very least tighten up your trailing stop loss to 5%. If the price breaks below an established uptrend line it may well be the end of the uptrend. The definition of an uptrend is higher highs and higher lows. As GEM has broken below the uptrend line and has maid a lower low, all that is needed to confirm the uptrend is over is a lower high. But months before the price broke below the uptrend line, the MACD momentum indicator was showing bearish divergence between it and the price. In early September 2014 the price made a higher high but the MACD made a lower high. This is called a bearish divergence and is an early warning signal that the momentum in the uptrend is weakening and the trend could be reversing soon. Notice I said could and not would. In this situation I would reduce my trailing stop to 10% and keep a watchful eye on this stock over the coming months. There are many other indicators that could be used as signals or as early warnings, but I thought I would talk about some of my favourites and ones I use on a daily and weekly basis. If you were to employ any of these techniques into your investing or trading it may take a little while to learn about them properly and to implement them into your trading plan, but once you have done that you would only need to spend 1 to 2 hours per week managing your portfolio if trading long-term or about 1 hour per nigh (after market close) if trading more medium term.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  There are several easy and quick methods available for predicting market trends over extended periods, and they can be employed independently or collectively. There are even additional tools to hint at potential market shifts. One such method is to utilize a Moving Average (MA) as a sell signal. It's simple: when the price falls below the MA, it's time to sell. You are likely to use a weekly or monthly chart and a sizable MA such as a 50-week or 100-week moving average if you are considering a long term. Although the longer the duration, the more the MA will trail the price, there will be less false alerts and whipsawing. For long-term (5 years +) analysis, I recommend using a 100 week Exponential MA on a weekly chart. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another valuable tool is the Rate Of Change (ROC) Indicator or a momentum indicator. The strategy for long-term market timing is to buy when the marker rises above zero and sell when it drops below zero. I usually use a 13-week EMA for the 52-week ROC for long-term investing, which helps to minimize the odds of false signals. These two indices can be utilized coherently. \n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of these indicators working in tandem can be seen in the S&P500 and the Australian S&P ASX200 trends over the last two decades. If I were to invest in an ETF tracking these indexes, I would use these two indicators cooperatively, leveraging the MA as a preliminary warning system and potentially tightening my stop losses to shield most of my profits from a possible market downturn. Then, the ROC Indicator can help sell the ETF entirely when it falls below zero or purchase back in when the ROC recovers back above zero. \n",
      "\n",
      "These indicators have proven useful in avoiding market downturns, as evident in the 2000 and 2008 downfall in the S&P500 and the 2008 breakdown of the ASX200. If your exit from the market is precipitated by a false signal, these indicators can help you rejoin if the signal goes back over zero. For instance, over a span of 20 years, you could have gained entry into the markets three times and exited twice for the S&P500. Similarly, with the ASX200, you would have had six entries and five exits over the same period. \n",
      "\n",
      "For individual shares, I would apply the ROC indicator against the primary index of the shares to gauge when to buy individual stocks and pay close attention to stop losses. My approach is to buy stocks on the rise in a market that's also rising and sell stocks on a decline in a falling market. \n",
      "\n",
      "Further, I would use trend lines and the MACD for individual stocks as early warning systems against potential trend reversals, tightening my stop loss even if the ROC is still positive. An example would be a GEM.AX 3-Year Weekly Chart. Simply put, if the price falls below the trend line, it might be appropriate to tighten up your trailing stop loss to 5% or exit from the position. \n",
      "\n",
      "While there are several other indicators that could serve as signals or early warnings, I've described some of the methods frequently employed in daily or weekly market tracking. Implementing these techniques into your investing may require some time for understanding and incorporation into your trading plan, but once done, managing your portfolio would require only 1 to 2 hours per week for long-term trading or about an hour per day (post-market closure) for medium-term trading.\n",

Another thought is depending where you are in your finances, delay by a day for every $100 in cost. e.g. For a $1000 purchase, sleep on it for 10 days. Adjust the number for your circumstance.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Talk to your bank first but shop around a bit as well with other reputable lenders in your area.  Another option, if you're willing to put down ~84% of the purchase price would be to talk to several dealerships BEFORE you set foot on a single lot. Tell them that you are interested in buying a Versa and that you are willing to pay cash but you are not willing to pay more than $10,200. They won't agree (trust me on that) but they will come down from $13,000. Say \"Thanks, I'll call you back.\" and call one of the other dealerships on your list and tell them \"I just spoke with this dealership and they are willing to sell me the car for [whatever number they gave you].\" One of two things will happen, either the dealership will come back with a lower price or they will tell you to go buy the car there. Continue this process until you have one dealership left.  I did this with 3 dealerships in 2011 and bought a truck with a $27,000 sticker price for just over $19,000. It took about a week to make all of the calls and I ended up going to a dealership 3 hours away but it was worth it for $8,000.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Start by contacting your own bank but don't confine yourself to one option, also explore other credible lenders nearby. Consider this strategy if you're ready to pay around 84% of the asking price upfront: engage with multiple dealers BEFORE you even visit a single dealership in person. Express your interest in purchasing a Versa and share your readiness to pay in cash, but make it clear that your budget is capped at $10,200. Though they won't readily agree (trust me on this), they will lower the price from $13,000. After thanking them for their offer and promising to get back, dial one of the other dealerships on your list and let them know about the adjusted price the first dealership offered. This will result in one of two outcomes, either the second dealership will offer a lower price or they will advise you to make the purchase at the initial dealership. Repeat this procedure until you're left with one last dealership. Using this strategy in 2011, I was able to get a truck with a price tag of $27,000 for slightly over $19,000. It took around a week to execute all the calls. Eventually, I ended up buying from a dealership located 3 hours away. But the comprehensive savings of $8,000 made it all worth it.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Only you can decide whether it's wise or not given your own personal circumstances. Brexit is certainly a big risk, and noone can really know what will happen yet. The specific worries you mention are certainly valid. Additionally you might find it hard to keep your job or get a new one if the economy turns bad, and in an extreme \"no deal\" scenario you might find yourself forced to leave - though I think that's very unlikely. House prices could also collapse leaving you in \"negative equity\". If you're planning on staying in the same location in the UK for a long time, a house tends to be a worthwhile investment, particularly as you always need somewhere to live, so owning it is a \"hedge\" against prices rising. Even if prices do fall, you do still have somewhere to live. If you're planning on going back to your home country at some point, that reduces the value of owning a house. If you want to reduce your risk, consider getting a mortgage with a long-term fixed rate. There are some available for 10 years, which I'd hope would be enough to get us over most of the Brexit volatility.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Determining whether it's prudent based on your personal situation is something only you can ascertain. The uncertainty surrounding Brexit is definitely a major risk, and it's difficult for anyone to predict the outcome. The concerns you've voiced are certainly reasonable. Furthermore, if the economy deteriorates, preserving your current employment or securing a new one may prove challenging, and in the case of a severe \"no deal\" scenario, you might be obligated to depart - although, I believe that is less likely to happen. A downfall in housing prices could land you in \"negative equity\" too. If your plan is to remain in the UK indefinitely, home ownership often proves to be a good investment, especially given that you'll always need a place to stay, therefore owning a property provides a safeguard against price surges. If prices plummet, at least you still have a place to call home. If you intend to return to your homeland eventually, the advantage of owning a house recedes. If you wish to mitigate risk, you might want to think about acquiring a mortgage that has a lengthy fixed rate. Some options offer a 10-year term which, hopefully would bypass most of Brexit's instability.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The whole point of a credit report and, by extension, a credit score, is to demonstrate (and judge) your ability to repay borrowed funds.  Everything stems from that goal; available credit, payment history, collections, etc all serve to demonstrate whether or not you personally are a good investment for lenders to pursue. Revolving credit balances are tricky because they are more complicated than fixed loans (for the rest of this answer, I'll just talk about credit cards, though it also applies to lines of credit such as overdraft protection for checking accounts, HELOCs, and other such products). Having a large available balance relative to your income means that at any time you could suddenly drown yourself in debt.  Having no credit cards means you don't have experience managing them (and personal finances are governed largely by behavior, meaning experience is invaluable).  Having credit cards but carrying a high balance means you know how to borrow money, but not pay it back.  Having credit cards but carrying no balance means you don't know how to borrow money (or you don't trust yourself to pay it back). Ideally, lenders will see a pattern of you borrowing a portion of the available credit, and then paying it down.  Generally that means utilizing up to 30% of your available credit.  Even if you maintain the balance in that range without paying it off completely, it at least shows that you have restraint, and are able to stop spending at a limit you personally set, rather than the limit the bank sets for you. So, to answer your question, 0% balance on your credit cards is bad because you might as well not have them.  Use it, pay it off, rinse and repeat, and it will demonstrate your ability to exercise self control as well as your ability to repay your debts.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  A credit report and consequently, a credit score, are designed to reflect and evaluate your competency to reimburse borrowed money. Everything ties back to this central objective, with factors such as available credit, payment history, and collections serving as indicators of whether you're a profitable risk for lenders to undertake. When it comes to revolving credit balances, understanding them can be a challenge due to their complex nature compared to fixed loans (for the remainder of this explanation, I'll focus on credit cards, but this also pertains to lines of credit like overdraft safeguards for checking accounts, HELOCs, and similar financial tools). Possessing a significant available credit relative to your earnings means you run the risk of suddenly submerging yourself in debt. Not having any credit cards signifies a lack of experience in managing them, and since personal finances are largely governed by behavior, experience is essential. If you have credit cards but maintain a high balance, it shows you can borrow money but struggle with repaying it. On the other hand, having credit cards with no balance on them could imply you lack understanding of how to borrow money or that you doubt your ability to repay it. The ideal outcome for lenders is to observe a pattern of you utilizing a portion of your available credit and subsequently reducing that amount. This typically means utilizing up to 30% of your available credit. Even if you keep the balance within this range without clearing it entirely, it displays your restraint and your ability to impose self-imposed spending limits rather than relying on the bank's limit. So, to directly answer your query, maintaining a 0% balance on your credit cards is seen as unfavorable because it's comparable to not having them at all. Utilize your cards, repay the balance, and repeat, and this will be a testament to your self-control and your skill in repaying loans.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The short answer is yes you probably can take the deduction for a home office because the space is used exclusively and you are working there for the convenience of your employer if you don't have a desk at your employers office. The long answer is that it may not be worth it to take the home office deduction as an employee. You're deduction is subject to a 2% AGI floor. You can only deduct a percentage of your rent or the depreciation on your home. A quick and dirty example if you make $75k/year, rent a 1200 sqft 2 bedroom apartment for $1000/month and use one bedroom (120 sqft) regularly and exclusively for your employer. You can deduct 10% (120sqft/1200sqft) of the $12000 ($1000*12 months (assumes your situation didn't change)) in rent or $1200. However because you are an employee you are subject to the 2% AGI floor so you can deduct $1200-$1500 (75000*.02 (salary * 2% floor)) = -300 so in order to deduct the first dollar you need an additional $300 worth of deductible expenses.  Depending on your situation it may or may not be worth it to take the home office deduction even if you qualify for it.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In summary, it's likely possible for you to claim a home office deduction if the space is solely and regularly used for your work, particularly if your employer doesn't provide you with a workspace. However, the comprehensive answer indicates that taking this deduction may not be beneficial as an employee. Your claim is limited by a 2% AGI baseline. You can only subtract a portion of your rent or the depreciation of your home. For instance, suppose you earn $75,000 per year, rent a 1200 sqft apartment with two bedrooms for $1000 per month, and one bedroom (120 sqft) is consistently and solely utilized for work. You could subtract 10% (120 sqft/1200 sqft) of the annual rent of $12,000 ($1000*12), which equals $1200. Nonetheless, as you are an employee, the 2% AGI baseline applies, constraining your deduction to $1200 minus $1500 (calculated as $75,000*0.02), which is -300 AUD. So, before you could claim this deduction, you would need additional deductible expenses worth $300. Consequently, depending on your situation, it might still not be beneficial to claim the home office deduction, even if you meet the prerequisites.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Value averaging has you shift the balance of your portfolio over time, not the amount of contributions.  So you can only do it if you have a portfolio holding both risky assets (shares etc) and some cash. You start out by making a plan about how much you will contribute every month and at what rate you expect the share part of the portfolio to grow.  Perhaps based on 20th century data you think an 8% growth rate is reasonable.  Or alternatively if you know your desired final amount obviously you can work backwards to a desired rate from that. If in any month the share part is falling below its expected growth path, you would put more money into it: possibly your whole paycheck contribution plus some from the savings cash account.  On the other hand if the share component is growing \"too fast\" you would put all your additional savings into cash.  So if your investments are doing well, you're not supposed to spend the excess money, but rather to put it aside into a dedicated cash account to top up your share component when prices fall. In theory, this has the auto-levelling benefit of Dollar Cost Averaging, but even better: when prices are high, you'll automatically buy fewer shares, or even sell some; conversely when prices are low you'll buy extra shares from your reserve account. If it turns out your estimate was unreasonably optimistic, and over your lifetime shares only ever average 3%, you'll end up with an entirely share portfolio, and a bumpier ride than you might have liked.  If you have horrible luck and over your entire investing life shares return less than cash (which has happened, though not yet in the USA), then this will be worse than a standard balanced portfolio. The original book Value Averaging by Edelson has a pretty good explanation of various cases, though I would say some of the examples are worked in excessive detail. I have not implemented this myself, one reason being that the amount I'm able to save from year to year varies, as it probably does for you, and so predicting a path is not quite so simple as he assumes.  You could still do it I suppose. I think you could get a very crude approximation to this by simply directing your savings into cash when the share market's rate of growth over the last several years is above what you think is the long term average.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In the strategy of value averaging, one gradually alters the composition of their investment portfolio instead of the quantity of contributions. This is only feasible if the portfolio consists of both volatile investments like shares alongside some cash. The initial step is to conceive a strategy around what your monthly contribution should be and the anticipated growth rate of the share segment of your portfolio. Maybe, based on historical data, you reckon an 8% annual growth rate is plausible. Or, if you have a specific target end sum, you can reverse calculate the necessary rate from it. If the equity portion underperforms in any given month, you should invest more money into it, potentially using your entire monthly contribution plus some from your savings account. Conversely, if the equity element overachieves, all your new savings should go into cash. Thus, any surplus money from performing investments should be allocated to a specific cash account to supplement your equity portion when stock prices dip. Theoretically, this provides the balancing advantage of Dollar Cost Averaging, but improves on it: when prices climb, you'll naturally acquire fewer shares, even offloading some, and when they plunge, you'll buy extra from your buffer account. However, if your forecast turns out to be overly hopeful and stocks average only a 3% return over your lifetime, you'll end up with a 100% equity portfolio, experiencing greater volatility than you may prefer. If you're extremely unfortunate and your lifetime return on equity is less than that of cash (something which has occurred, but not yet in the U.S.), this will prove inferior to a traditional balanced portfolio. Edelson's seminal book, Value Averaging, offers a decent explanation of different scenarios, although I believe the examples are sometimes excessively detailed. I haven't practiced this approach myself, primarily because the amount I save varies from year to year, as it likely does for you, rendering path prediction less straightforward than he suggests. Nevertheless, it's still a viable option. A rudimentary adaptation of this would be to funnel your savings into cash when the share market's recent multi-year growth rate outpaces your long term average anticipations.\n",

      "Reference Response:  One piece of information you didn't mention is how much you paid for the original home.  If you hold onto that home for too long you will have to pay capital gains on the difference between sale price and original price. This can be a TON of money, thousands of dollars easily. The rule is: If you lived in a home for 2 out of the past 5 years, you don't have to pay the capital gains tax. So  if you just moved, you have 3 years to sell.  Perhaps as a compromise you can try renting it for 3 years and then selling it a few months before the deadline.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  You forgot to disclose the price you purchased the original house for. If you retain ownership over that property for an extended period, you'll be liable for capital gains tax on the discrepancy between the sale and purchase prices. This could amount to substantial sums, easily reaching into the thousands of dollars. However, there's a rule: No capital gains tax is necessary if you inhabited the house for 2 of the last 5 years. Therefore, if you've just relocated, you've got three years to finalise a sale. An alternative solution could be to rent it out for 3 years and sell it just before the time limit expires.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Yes you should worry and take care not to violate the law or provide any appearance of impropriety.   Every bank in the USA is required under the Bank Secrecy Act to report cash transactions over $10,000 the same day to the IRS -- and here's the fun secret part -- without notification to the depositor.   But splitting the deposits up into smaller amounts is also a crime, called \"structuring\".   On occasion there is a news story where a retail business that naturally must deposit cash from customers will be (falsely?) accused of structuring, e.g.:  Feds seize grocery store's entire bank account -- Institute for Justice defends grocer Under the legal doctrine of civil asset forfeiture, your money can be accused of a crime, seized, and tried separately from its owner.  The actual cases indicate the money as defendant, i.e. \"US v $124,700\" In this somewhat bizarre system of \"justice\", the owner need not be charged with a crime, and is not in immediate peril of going to prison (about the only upside in this, but might be temporary because the authorities haven't charged the owner yet).  When only the money is charged with a crime, there is no requirement for the government to supply a public defender for the owners who can not afford a lawyer.... can not afford a lawyer, because the government took all their money....\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Indeed, it's crucial that you take caution to avoid breaking the law or even giving off an impression of misconduct. Every bank in the United States is mandated by the Bank Secrecy Act to report cash operations surpassing $10,000 to the IRS on the same day without any prior warning to the person depositing the money. Nonetheless, distributing these deposits into smaller sums is, too, considered a crime, referred to as \"structuring\". Occasionally, we hear news about a retail shop being (mistakenly?) charged with structuring, for instance, a situation where the federal government seizes a grocer's entire bank account, which motivated the Institute for Justice to step in for their defense. Through civil asset forfeiture legal principle, your money can get implicated, seized, and prosecuted separate from its owner. These cases usually have the money as the defendant, illustrated as \"US v $124,700\". In this peculiarly twisted legal system, the owner isn't obligated immediate imprisonment (one of the few privileges, though it could be short-lived if charges against the owner pending). When the money alone is implicated in a crime, the government bears no responsibility for providing a public defender for owners who can't afford legal support... unable to afford a lawyer because all their assets have been taken by the government....\n",

      "Reference Response:  @sdg - If you can be flippant, I can be pedantic. Insider Trading is not illegal. Any employee of a company can be an insider, yet most of their trades are perfectly legal. What is illegal is trading on Inside Information. Such information may be available to those within a company, or those who have some contact with an employee. In fact, if I am seated at a restaurant table and hear Bill and Warren talking about a purchase they plan to make, I am in possession of inside information and risk prosecution should I purchase shares and profit.  Often, a company will have a \"quiet period\" before earnings reports or potential stock-price-moving-news. During this time, employees are forbidden from buying or selling shares, excluding those that would be automatically bought in their retirement accounts or ESPP.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  @sdg - Should you chose to be sarcastic, let me be meticulous. Insider Trading isn't outlawed. Being an insider is a potential role for any company staff, with most of their transactions being completely lawful. The illegality occurs when trading revolves around Inside Information. This type of information could be accessible to company personnel, or individuals in touch with them. For example, I could find myself sitting at a restaurant, overhearing Bill and Warren discuss a planned investment. Holding this inside information, I could face legal action if I buy stocks and gain from it. Companies often implement a \"silent phase\" prior to the release of earnings reports or considerable share-price-impact news. During this phase, staff are prohibited from buying or selling shares — the only exceptions being shares which would be auto-acquired in retirement funds or ESPP.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Given the current low interest rates - let's assume 4% - this might be a viable option for a lot of people.  Let's also assume that your actual interest rate after figuring in tax considerations ends up at around 3%.  I think I am being pretty fair with the numbers. Now every dollar that you save each month based on the savings and invest with a higher net return of greater than 3% will in fact be \"free money\".  You are basically betting on your ability to invest over the 3%.  Even if using a conservative historical rate of return on the market you should net far better than 3%.  This money would be significant after 10 years.   Let's say you earn an average of 8% on your money over the 10 years.  Well you would have an extra $77K by doing interest only if you were paying on average of $500 a month towards interest on a conventional loan.  That is a pretty average house in the US.  Who doesn't want $77K (more than you would have compared to just principal).  So after 10 years you have the same amount in principal plus $77k given that you take all of the saved money and invest it at the constraints above. I would suggest that people take interest only if they are willing to diligently put away the money as they had a conventional loan.  Another scenario would be a wealthier home owner (that may be able to pay off house at any time) to reap the tax breaks and cheap money to invest. Pros: Cons: Sidenote:  If people ask how viable is this.  Well I have done this for 8 years.  I have earned an extra 110K.  I have smaller than $500 I put away each month since my house is about 30% owned but have earned almost 14% on average over the last 8 years.  My money gets put into an e-trade account automatically each month from there I funnel it into different funds (diversified by sector and region).  I literally spend a few minutes a month on this and I truly act like the money isn't there.  What is also nice is that the bank will account for about half of this as being a liquid asset when I have to renegotiate another loan.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In the present climate of low interest rates, say for instance 4%, this option may be feasible for a considerable number of individuals. Assuming that after accounting for tax details, the real interest rate comes to around 3%, I believe these estimations are quite reasonable. As a result, every saved dollar that you invest each month with a net return exceeding 3% can be considered as \"free money\". Essentially, you are gambling on your proficiency to yield an investment return above 3%. When tying a moderate historical rate of return from the market, it should yield a better return than 3%. This sum could be substantial after a decade. Imagine earning an average of 8% on your money over this 10-year period while paying on average $500 per month for the interest on a standard loan, which could mimic an average-priced house in the US. Who wouldn't want an additional $77K (more than you would've received compared to the principal only). Therefore, after a decade, you have the unchanged amount in principal along with an extra $77k if you diligently invest all the saved funds as discussed earlier. I would advise that people should only seek an interest-only option if they're able to consistently save the money as if they were on a traditional loan. Another likely case would be a more affluent homeowner who can clear the mortgage at any point, using the benefit of tax relief and inexpensive investment funds. Pros: Cons: Sidenote: Asked about its practicality? I've been doing this for eight years now. I've earned a bonus of $110K, dedicating under $500 monthly as I roughly own 30% of my house and gained an average return of nearly 14% over these eight years. I transfer my funds into an E-trade account each month, then distribute it into different diversified funds according to sectors and regions. I spend only a few moments each month doing this, treating this money as if it doesn't exist. Another merit is that the bank considers about half of this as a liquid asset, which is helpful when renegotiating for another loan.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Some of the 45,000 might be taxable. The question is how was the stipend determined. Was it based on the days away? The mile driven? The cities you worked in? The IRS has guidelines regarding what is taxable in  IRS Pub 15 Per diem or other fixed allowance.  You may reimburse your employees by travel days, miles, or some other   fixed allowance under the applicable revenue procedure. In these   cases, your employee is considered to have accounted to you if your   reimbursement doesn't exceed rates established by the Federal   Government. The 2015 standard mileage rate for auto expenses was 57.5   cents per mile. The rate for 2016 is 54 cents per mile. The government per diem rates for meals and lodging in the continental   United States can be found by visiting the U.S. General Services   Administration website at www.GSA.gov and entering \"per diem rates\" in   the search box. Other than the amount of these expenses, your   employees' business expenses must be substantiated (for example, the   business purpose of the travel or the number of business miles   driven). For information on substantiation methods, see Pub. 463. If the per diem or allowance paid exceeds the amounts substantiated,   you must report the excess amount as wages. This excess amount is   subject to income tax with-holding and payment of social security,   Medicare, and FUTA taxes. Show the amount equal to the substantiated   amount (for example, the nontaxable portion) in box 12 of Form W-2   using code “L\"\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  A portion of the 45,000 may be subject to tax, subject to how the allowance was established. Was it calculated on the basis of days spent away, miles travelled, or the cities in which you were employed? The IRS provides guidelines to determine what is tax-deductible in IRS Pub 15 concerning per diem or other fixed allowances. You have the option to offset your workers based on travel days, mileage, or another fixed allowance following the suitable revenue procedure. If the reimbursement you provide doesn't surpass federal government-set rates, it is deemed as accounted for. The standard mileage rate was 57.5 cents per mile in 2015, and reduced to 54 cents in 2016. Government-defined per diem rates for meals and accommodations within the US can be found on the U.S. General Services Administration site at www.GSA.gov by searching \"per diem rates\". Apart from these expense amounts, the business costs of your employees need to be justified, such as the purpose of the business trip or the number of miles driven for business. Consult Pub. 463 for methods of substantiation. If the per diem or allowance provided exceeds substantiated amounts, you must declare the surplus portion as income. This surplus is subject to income tax withholding and the formulation of social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes.

      "Reference Response:  Since you already have twice your target in that emergency fund, putting that overage to work is a good idea. The impression that I get is that you'd still like to stay on the safe side. What you're looking for is a Balanced Fund.  In a balanced fund the managers invest in both stocks and bonds (and cash). Since you have that diversification between those two asset classes, their returns tend to be much less volatile than other funds. Also, because of their intended audience and the traditions from that class of funds' long history, they tend to invest somewhat more conservatively in both asset classes.  There are two general types of balanced funds: Conservative Allocation funds and Moderate Allocation funds. Conservative allocation funds invest in more fixed income than equity (the classic mix is 60% bonds, 40% stocks). Moderate allocation funds invest in more equity than fixed income (classic mix: 40% bonds, 60% stocks). A good pair of funds that are similar but exemplify the difference between conservative allocation and moderate allocation are Vanguard's Wellesley Income Fund (VWINX) for the former and Vanguard's Wellington Fund (VWELX) for the latter.

      "Paraphrased Response:  Seeing as your emergency fund has already doubled your set goal, it would be prudent to make the surplus work in your favor. From my understanding, you'd prefer a minimal-risk investment strategy. The solution you need might be a Balanced Fund. This type of fund allows managers to invest in both stocks and bonds, as well as cash. The risk is significantly reduced since your investment would be diversified between these asset categories, making the returns less likely to fluctuate excessively as they do in other funds. Furthermore, taking into account their target demographic and the long-standing practices from their historical background, these funds typically lean towards a more cautious investment in both asset types. Balanced funds can be split into two main categories: Conservative Allocation funds and Moderate Allocation funds. While conservative ones invest more in fixed income than equity (typically a 60-40% bonds-stocks ratio), moderate allocation funds imply a greater equity than fixed income investment (usually a 40-60% bonds-stocks ratio). Vanguard's Wellesley Income Fund (VWINX) and Wellington Fund (VWELX) are perfect examples to illustrate the difference between the two types of allocation, respectively conservative and moderate (Please note, whilst both funds are generally deemed reliable, this is not an endorsement).

      "Reference Response: Reference Response:  Another suggestion I heard on the radio was to give the child the difference between the name brand they want, and the store brand they settle on.  Then that money can be accumulated as savings. Saving money is as important a feature of the family economy as earning money. Be careful with what you have a child do for reward vs what you have them do as a responsibility.  Don't set a dangerous precedent that certain work does not need to be done unless compensation is on the table.  You might have a child who relies on external motivations only to do things, which can make school work and future employment hard. I would instead have my child do yard work, but while doing it explain opportunity costs of doing the work yourself vs hiring out.  I would show my kid how saving money earns interest, and how that is essentially free money.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I once listened to an idea on the radio suggesting to make up the difference between a popular brand that the child desires and the generic brand they ultimately choose, accumulating this saved amount. The act of saving money is as pivotal in the family's financial dynamic as the act of earning money. Be mindful of separating tasks you expect a child to complete for a reward versus tasks they're obligated to perform. Avoid establishing the risky notion that certain chores don't require effort unless there's a payoff involved. This could breed a dependence on extrinsic motivations to get things done, making academic tasks and later career prospects challenging. Ideally, I'd have my kid involved in gardening chores, but while at it, I'd detail the opportunity costs between doing the labor oneself compared to outsourcing. I'd educate my child on how saved money accrues interest, effectively translating into bonus money.\n",

      " Trade-in values are generally below what you can get in a private sale. To directly answer your question, you should sell the crossover yourself and use the balance to purchase your new vehicle. I would encourage you to use the $9k to finance directly without a lease, especially if you are planning on financing after the lease term. The lease will not save you money over the time you drive the vehicle in this case, and worse, will likely expose you to risk of having to pay additional fees if you break certain terms in the lease (mileage, wear and tear, etc) Best option mathematically is to use the $9k to purchase a vehicle for cash. This provides the lowest total cost of ownership.  Even if you are afraid of purchasing a lemon, leasing a vehicle is awfully expensive insurance against that possibility. You would have to rack up some significant repairs to justify the cost of the lease vs cash over the term of operating the vehicle.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Usually, the amount you get from a trade-in is less than what you'd receive from selling privately. Responding to your query, it's advisable that you personally sell your crossover and utilize the profit to acquire your new car. I'd suggest using your $9k directly to finance, rather than lease, particularly if you plan to finance post-lease. Contrary to common belief, the lease won't provide financial benefits as you use the car and potentially subjects you to extra charges if you violate any lease conditions, such as mileage violations or excessive wear and tear. From a numerical standpoint, the best approach is to use the $9k to buy a car outright, resulting in the least total ownership cost. Despite the fear of landing a defective used car, car leasing is an extravagantly priced safeguard against that. Significant repair expenses would have to be incurred to offset the cost difference between leasing and buying outright during the vehicle's usage period.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Here's another answer on the topic: Saving for retirement: How much is enough? An angle on it this question made me think of: a good approach here is to focus on savings rate (which you can control) rather than the final number (which you can't, plus it will fluctuate with the markets and make you nervous). For example, focus on saving at least 10% of your income annually (15% is much safer).  If you focus on the final number: The way it works in the real world is that you save as much as you can, but there are lots of random factors and unknowns. Some people end up having to work a lot longer than they hoped to. Others end up able to retire early. Others retire on time but have to spend less than they hoped. But the one thing you can often control (as long as you have an income and no catastrophes, anyway) is that you spend less than you make.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Here's a different take on the subject matter: How much should we save for retirement? This question prompted me to consider a new perspective. Rather than fret over the final figures—which are impossible to control and will inevitably fluctuate due to unpredictable market conditions—you should concentrate on your personal savings rate. For instance, aim to set aside a minimum of 10% of your yearly income, though a target of 15% is far more reliable. If you focus only on the final amount, you'll realize that real-world situations require you to save as much as possible in the face of countless variables and uncertainties. Some individuals might need to work longer than anticipated, while some might have the opportunity to retire early. Some may retire according to plan but have to be more frugal than they'd like. However, one area you often have control over, barring any calamities or loss of income, is your ability to maintain expenditure lower than your earnings.\n",

I prefer that method versus comparing with others since it is objective for yourself and looks beyond just the bare prices.\n",

      "Reference Response:  If you qualify for the safe harbor, you are not required to pay additional quarterly taxes.  Of course, you're still welcome to do so if you're sure you'll owe them; however, you will not be penalized. If your income is over $150k (joint) or $75k (single), your safe harbor is: Estimated tax safe harbor for higher income taxpayers. If your 2014 adjusted gross income was more than $150,000 ($75,000 if you are married filing a separate return), you must pay the smaller of 90% of your expected tax for 2015 or 110% of the tax shown on your 2014 return to avoid an estimated tax penalty. Generally, if you're under that level, the following reasons suggest you will not owe the tax (from the IRS publication 505): The total of your withholding and timely estimated tax payments was at least as much as your 2013 tax. (See Special rules for certain individuals for higher income taxpayers and farmers and fishermen.) The tax balance due on your 2014 return is no more than 10% of your total 2014 tax, and you paid all required estimated tax payments on time. Your total tax for 2014 (defined later) minus your withholding is less than $1,000. You did not have a tax liability for 2013. You did not have any withholding taxes and your current year tax (less any household employment taxes) is less than $1,000. If you paid one-fourth of your last year's taxes (or of 110% of your last-year's taxes) in estimated taxes for each quarter prior to this one, you should be fine as far as penalties go, and can simply add the excess you know you will owe to the next check.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Qualifying for the safe harbor means you're not obligated to pay extra quarterly taxes, although it's acceptable if you choose to do so, realizing you owe some, with no penalties to be suffered. If you're earning above $150k in joint income or $75k as a single taxpayer, your safe harbor is defined as the estimated tax safe harbor for higher income taxpayers. If in 2014 your adjusted gross income exceeded $150,000 ($75,000 for married persons filing separately), to evade the estimated tax penalty, you need to pay the lesser amount of 90% of your 2015 anticipated tax or 110% of your 2014 tax. Typically, if your income falls below this range, several reasons indicated in the IRS publication 505 suggest you won't be liable for the tax: Your total withholding and timely estimated tax payments equal or surpass your 2013 tax, specific rules applicable to higher income individuals, farmers, and fishermen are considered. Your tax liability on your 2014 return doesn't exceed 10% of your total 2014 tax and all mandatory estimated tax payments were made promptly. The difference between your total tax for 2014 and your withholding is under $1,000. You encountered no tax liability for 2013. Also, you didn't withhold any taxes and your present year tax (minus any household employment taxes) is below $1,000. If you've already made quarterly payments of one-fourth of your tax from the previous year (or 110% of that amount), you should be safe from penalties, and you can just append any surplus you expect to owe to the subsequent check.\n",

Their numbers have certainly dwindled, however, and it's reasonable to expect the number of floor traders to decrease even more as electronic trading continues to grow. A key reason for human brokers, however, is due to privacy. Certain private exchanges such as dark pools maintain privacy for high profile clients and institutional investors, and human brokers are needed to execute anonymous deals in these venues. Even in this region, however, technology is supplanting the need for brokers. I don't believe there is any human-broker-free stock exchange, but Nasdaq and other traditionally OTC (over the counter) exchanges are as close as it gets since they never even had trading floors.\n",

As electronic trading consistently expands, we can foresee a further reduction in the count of floor traders. A significant factor for the necessity of human brokers lies in the aspect of privacy. Certain confidential exchanges like dark pools ensure privacy for high-profile clients and institutional investors, necessitating human brokers to perform anonymous transactions in these platforms. Nevertheless, in this sphere too, technology is increasingly replacing the need for brokers.

The Bank Identifier Code – also referred to as BIC, SWIFT Code, SWIFT BIC, or SWIFT ID – is another global standard used for all international transfers.

The merchant isn't \"holding\" your money, your bank or card provider is protecting itself from you overdrawing. In general, it takes 1-3 days for a credit transaction to settle. With a credit card, this usually isn't an issue, unless you have a very low credit line or other unusual things going on. With pre-paid and debit cards, it is an issue, since your spending power is contingent upon you having an available balance.

Generally, the settlement of a credit transaction transpires in 1-3 days. This doesn't usually present problems with a credit card, unless there are peculiar circumstances or an extremely low credit limit.

      "Reference Response:  (the average person doesn't care nor are they affected by how much their employer spends in healthcare) It may be true that the average person doesn't care how much their employer spends on healthcare, but it's not true that we aren't affected.  From an employer's perspective, healthcare, wages, and all other benefits are part of the cost of having an employee.  When healthcare goes up, it increases the total employee cost.   Employers can handle this in several ways.  They could reduce the amount they give investors (as dividends, stock buybacks, etc.).  But then the stock is worth less and they have to make up the money somewhere else.  They could pass the expense on to customers.  But then the loss in business can easily cost more than the revenue raised.  They can cut wages or other benefits.  Then the average person will start caring...and might get a different job.   (I found this article saying that 12M households spend >=50% of income on rent, so I'm assuming that an even greater number spend more than the recommended 30%, which means rent should be weighted as high as it is in CPI.) According to the census, that's only about 10% of households.  It also notes that 64.4% of households are owner-occupied.  They don't pay rent.  The CPI makes up a number called owner's equivalent rent for those households to get to the higher percentage.   The CPI is intended for things like wages.  This makes it a good choice for a cost of living adjustment, but it doesn't quite represent the overall economy.  And for investments, it's the broader economy that matters.  Household consumption is less important.   What the Fed says.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  While it might be correct to say that the average individual is indifferent to the amount their employer spends on healthcare, it's inaccurate to claim that they aren't impacted. When viewed from an employer's standpoint, healthcare, wages, and any additional benefits are all components of the cost of employing a person. Employee costs surge when healthcare expenses increase. Employers have multiple strategies to cope with this. They could decrease the profits distributed to investors through dividends or stock repurchases; however, this devalues the stock, necessitating financial compensation elsewhere. They could transfer the cost to consumers, but the resulting business loss could surpass the generated revenue. The alternative is to slash salaries or other benefits. This might make the average worker pay more attention and possibly change jobs. However, according to an article I read, approximately 12 million households spend half or more of their income on rent. By extension, it's likely that an even more significant number of households spend more than the advised 30% threshold on rent, which justifies its high weightage in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The census reveals that this only represents about 10% of households, noting that 64.4% of households are occupant-owned, thus not necessarily incurring rent. For these households, the CPI creates a figure termed 'owner's equivalent rent' to reach the higher percentage. The CPI is designed primarily for things such as salaries, making it a suitable option for cost of living adjustments. However, it doesn't precisely represent the wider economy. When it comes to investments, the general economy plays a crucial role, and household consumption becomes less significant. Here's what the Federal Reserve has to say...\n",

      "Reference Response:  Shares in a company represent a portion of a company. If that company takes in money and doesn't pay it out as a dividend (e.g. Apple), the company is still more valuable because it has cold hard cash as an asset. Theoretically, it's all the same whether your share of the money is inside the company or outside the company; the only immediate difference is tax treatment.  Of course, for large bank accounts that means that an investment in the company is a mix of investment in the bank account and investment in the business-value of the company, which may stymie investors who aren't particularly interested in buying larve amounts of bank accounts (known for low returns) and would prefer to receive their share of the cash to invest elsewhere (or in the business portion of the company.) Companies like Apple have in fact taken criticism for this. Your company could also use that cash to invest in itself (growing the value of its profits) or buy other companies that are worth money, essentially doing the job for you. Of course, they can do the job well or they can do it poorly... A company could also be acquired by a larger company, or taken private, in exchange for cash or the stock of another company. This is another way that the company's value could be returned to its shareholders.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Owning shares in a company is essentially owning a piece of that firm. When the said company garners money and elects not to disburse it as dividends, for instance, Apple, its value increases as hard cash is now part of its assets. In essence, it makes no difference whether your cash is retained within the firm or taken out; the tax effects are the only direct differences. Notably, large bank balances mean that an investment in such a firm is split between the business's worth and the cash in the bank, which might discourage potential investors who do not wish to purchase huge volumes of banking assets known for low yields and would rather opt to reinvest their cash share elsewhere. Certain companies, such as Apple, have come under fire due to this practice. Moreover, a firm could utilize this money to further its growth and increase its earnings or to acquire other profitable firms; acting as a surrogate investor on your behalf. Obviously, the results could be either successful or disastrous. Additionally, a company can increase its value to its shareholders by being bought over by a larger firm or going private in return for cash or shares in another firm.\n",

      "Reference Response:  There are many different kinds of SEC filings with different purposes.  Broadly speaking, what they have in common is that they are the ways that companies publicly disclose information that they are legally required to disclose.  The page that you listed gives brief descriptions of many types, but if you click through to the articles on individual types of filings, you can get more info. One of the most commonly discussed filings is the 10-K, which is, as Wikipedia says, \"a comprehensive summary of a company's financial performance\".  This includes info like earnings and executive pay. One example of a form that some people believe has potential utility for investors is Form 4, which is a disclosure of \"insider trading\".  People with a privileged stake in a company (executives, directors, and major shareholders) cannot legally buy or sell shares without disclosing it by filing a Form 4.  Some people think that you can make use of this information in the sense that if, for instance, the CEO of Google buys a bunch of Twitter stock, they may have some reason for thinking it will go up, so maybe you should buy it too.  Whether such inferences are accurate, and whether you can garner a practical benefit from them (i.e., whether you can manage to buy before everyone else notices and drives the price up) is debatable. My personal opinion would be that, for an average retail investor, readng SEC filings is unlikely to be useful.  The reason is that an average retail investor shouldn't be investing in individual companies at all, but rather in mutual funds or ETFs, which typically provide comparable returns with far less risk.  SEC filings are made by individual companies, so it doesn't generally help you to read them unless you're going to take action related to an individual company.  It doesn't generally make sense to take action related to an individual company if you don't have the time and energy to read a large number of SEC filings to decide which company to take action on.  If you have the time and energy to read a large number of SEC filings, you're probably not an average retail investor.  If you are a wheeler dealer who plays in the big leagues, you might benefit from reading SEC filings.  However, if you aren't already reading SEC filings, you're probably not a wheeler dealer who plays in the big leagues. That said, if you're a currently-average investor with big dreams, it could be instructive to read a few filings to explore what you might do with them.  You could, for instance, allocate a \"play money\" fund of a few thousand dollars and try your hand at following insider trades or the like.  If you make some money, great; if not, oh well.  Realistically, though, there are so many people who make a living reading SEC filings and acting on them every day that you have little chance of finding a \"diamond in the rough\" unless you also make a living by doing it every day. It's sort of like asking \"Should I read Boating Monthly to improve my sailing skills?\"  If you're asking because you want to rent a Hobie Cat and go for a pleasure cruise now and then, sure, it can't hurt.  If you're asking because you want to enter the America's Cup, you can still read Boating Monthly, but it won't in itself meaningfully increase your chances of winning the America's Cup.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  There's a variety of SEC filings serving unique objectives, all aimed at public disclosure of legally mandated information by firms. The webpage you mentioned provides a concise overview of many types, allowing for deeper investigation via individual filing links for more detailed information. The 10-K filing is frequently referenced, defined by Wikipedia as \"an all-embracing report of a firm's financial results\", covering aspects such as revenue and executive compensation. Some suggest that Form 4, the \"insider trading\" disclosure, may present investment opportunities for certain investors. This form requires key company figures (e.g., executives, directors, large shareholders) to declare their trading activities. Reading these forms could potentially reveal trading strategy clues, like if the Google CEO invested heavily in Twitter stocks, which might affect your investment decisions accordingly. However, the reliability of these assumptions and the probability of capitalizing on them before the market adjusts the price is a topic of discussion. In my personal judgement, the ordinary retail investor may not significantly benefit from examining SEC filings. This is due to the fact that common retail investors should ideally invest in ETFs or mutual funds, which typically offer similar returns with considerably lower risk. SEC filings are created for individual firms, and don't generally aid in your investment strategy unless that involves action specific to a single company. Devoting necessary time and effort to review a plethora of SEC filings to identify a single company to invest in would not be a practical approach for a retail investor. You can potentially gain from scrutinizing SEC filings if you are a prominent, active trader. However, if you weren't already perusing SEC filings, you're likely not a high-profile investor. Nonetheless, if you're an aspiring investor with big ambitions, analyzing a few filings might provide valuable insights. For example, you could allot a small \"experimental\" fund to try observing insider transactions. If you profit, fantastic - if not, not a huge loss. But considering the high volume of professional market players who profit from daily SEC filing analysis, finding an overlooked advantageous opportunity unless you're investing full-time is highly unlikely. The analogy would be whether reading a monthly boating magazine contributes to better sailing skills. If you're looking to occasionally rent a catamaran for a fun jaunt, sure, it can't hurt. If you're aspiring to compete in the America's Cup, while you can still read the magazine, it's unlikely to significantly affect your winning chances.\n",

The two critical elements are 1) it's the only realistic way for a civilian to get leverage. this is why it almost always blows away \"tinkering in the stock markets\" in the 10-year frame. 2) but perhaps more importantly - it's a really \"enforced\" saving plan. you just have to pay it off every month. There are other huge advantages like, it's the best possible equity for a civilian, so you can get loans in the future to start your dotcom, etc. Try to buy yourself a very modest little flat (perhaps to rent out?) or even something like a garage or storeroom.  Real estate can crash, but it's very unlikely; it only happens in end of the world situations where it won't matter anyway.  When real estate drops say 30% everyone yells about that being a \"crash\" - I've never, ever owned a stock that hasn't had 30% down times. Food for thought!\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Investing in basic residential real estate does hold a good deal of merit, just as our elders have long counseled. Its key benefits include being the most attainable form of leverage for an average person, easily outperforming playing with the stock market over a decade. Secondly, it forces a disciplined savings routine, requiring monthly payments. Additional advantages are plentiful, such as providing a solid equity base that can facilitate future loans for entrepreneurial ventures and so forth. Consider making an entry-level purchase like a small apartment, possibly for letting, or even a storage space or garage. While there are risks of market crashes, they're highly unlikely unless in truly catastrophic scenarios.

      "Reference Response:  True blue preferred shares are considered loose hybrids of credit and equity.  They are more senior than common equity in bankruptcy liquidation but pay out a dividend which is not mandatory. Financial institutions issue the bulk of genuine preferred shares because of their need for more flexibility than a bond but not so much that they can afford the cost to shareholders by diluting common equity. Since it is a credit-like security that receives none of the income from operations but merely pays out a potentially unpredictable yet fixed amount of income, it will perform much more like a bond, rising when interest rates fall and vice versa, and since interest rates do not move to the extent of common equity valuations, preferreds' price variances will correspond much more to bonds than common equities.  If the company stops paying the preferred dividend or looks to become in financial trouble, the price of the preferred share should be expected to fall. There are more modern preferred however.  It has now become popular to fund intermediate startups with convertible preferred shares.  Because these are derivatives based upon the common equity, they can be expected to be much more variant.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Shares known as \"true blue preferred\" are often viewed as a mix between credit and equity. They rank higher than regular equity during bankruptcy liquidation, although they provide dividends that are not obligatory. The majority of these genuine preferred shares are issued by financial institutions in need of more flexibility than bonds offer, but without having to bear the cost of diluting common equity. A preferred share behaves very similarly to a credit as it doesn't take in any operational income, only providing a possibly fluctuating fixed income. Hence, its performance will resemble that of a bond - increasing when interest rates decrease, and vice versa. However, preferreds' price changes will more closely mirror the behavior of bonds than that of common equities, since interest rates don't fluctuate to the degree of common equity valuations. If conditions change such that the company ceases paying the preferred dividend or runs into financial problems, you could presume that the price of the preferred share would decrease. Yet, there are more contemporary types of preferred shares. Convertible preferred shares have gained popularity as a method of funding emerging startups. Given that these are derivatives of the common equity, they are likely to have greater price variation.\n",

      "Reference Response:  What you are asking about is called Interest Rate Parity. Or for a longer explanation the article Interest Rate Parity at Wikipedia.  If the US has a rate of say zero, and the rate in Elbonia is 10%, one believes that in a year the exchange rate will be shifted by 10%, i.e. it will take 1.1 unit of their currency to get the dollars one unit did prior.  Else, you'd always profit from such FOREX trades.  (Disclaimer - I am not claiming this to be true or false, just offering one theory that explains the rate difference effect on future exchange rates.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The concept you're inquiring about is termed as Interest Rate Parity. If you want a more comprehensive explanation, refer to the Wikipedia article on Interest Rate Parity. Imagine a scenario where the interest rate in the US is zero, for instance, and the rate in Elbonia is 10%. In such a case, one could predict that the exchange rate would adjust by a percentage of 10% after a year. This means one would require 1.1 units of their currency to secure the same value in dollars as previously achieved with just one unit. Otherwise, you would always gain from such foreign exchange trades. Note, this is purely theoretical and I do not guarantee the veracity or falsity of this theory; it's merely a possible explanation for how rate differences could affect future exchange rates.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Ask around your area. Some stores will exchange because it saves them having to go to the bank to stock up on change. Some stores have machines that will convert the coins for a small percentage fee.  Some banks may do this exchange for folks who aren't customers, though that's uncommon.  My solution was to open a small account locally specifically as a place to dump my coins into. They'll even run a pile of coins through their counting machine for me, free, so I don't have to make up coin rolls as I did in the past.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Investigate within your locality. There are shops that offer exchange services as it helps them avoid the hassle of visiting a bank to replenish their change. Certain establishments possess devices that can transform coins into cash for a nominal charge. Also, while it's rare, there are banks that provide this exchange service even to non-customers. My personal approach was to establish a minimal account in a local bank, specifically for depositing my coins.

      "Reference Response:  As this is anonymous, can you give us actual numbers? I can make guesses based on your percentages, but it would help. Lets assume you both make $35k (since you said child care would take up the bulk of your wife's income, it must be fairly low incomes) The answer usually isn't a simple \"do this\", but small adjustments in your lifestyle which add up. Church offering is 17%, the standard tithe is 10%. Lower it? It's the most obvious large non-required expense. Transportation is almost 10% of your income. If my numbers are right, that is somewhere around $500 per month? What kind of car/cars do you have? There are very cheap used cars which cost very little in upkeep / fuel. Is it possible your cars are more expensive than needed? My wife and I bought a used car for around $8k in cash a few years ago. Still running strong, only have done oil changes since then. Food is 12%, which would be perhaps $600 or $700 per month. That seems awfully high. Maybe I'm wrong about your salaries :) You said you were cheap, but now the numbers don't add up. Mortgage of 35% ($2k with escrow if I'm guessing on salaries right) seems reasonable. I'm assuming you don't want to downsize, particularly if you're going to have kids. Do you have a great mortgage rate? I assume you're on a 30 year fixed already?\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Since this is anonymous, could you share the actual figures? I can derive approximations from your percentages, but having precise numbers would be better. Suppose, for a moment, that your annual income is $35k (I inferred as much since you mentioned child care consumes most of your spouse's earnings, which likely implies a lower income bracket.) The solution usually isn't a straightforward action, but rather small lifestyle tweaks that accumulate to significant changes. As for your church donation, you're giving 17%, whereas the standard tithe is just 10%. Could you potentially cut back there? It seems to be your biggest unnecessary expenditure. Transport costs make up nearly 10% of your income. If my computations are accurate, this rounds up to about $500 per month. Can I inquire about the type of vehicle/s you own? There are several low-maintenance, fuel-efficient used cars available out there. Could it be that your vehicles are pricier than required? A few years ago, my spouse and you purchased a used car for about $8k in cash. It's still in excellent condition, requiring nothing more than regular oil changes so far. Your food expenses account for 12%, which equals about $600 to $700 a month. That appears to be a tad excessive. However, I could be mistaken about your income :) Earlier on, you mentioned being frugal, yet the numbers don't seem to align with that assertion. The mortgage, which takes up 35% of your income  (approx. $2k with escrow assuming my salary estimates are correct) appears to be reasonable. I gather you're not keen on downsizing, especially if children are in your future plans. Do you have an advantageous mortgage rate? I'm guessing you're already on a 30-year fixed mortgage?\n",

      "Reference Response:  There are hundreds of entities which offer mutual funds - too many to adequately address here. If you need to pick one, just go with Vanguard for the low low low fees. Yes, this is important. A typical expense ratio of 1% may not sound like much until you realize that the annualized real rate of return on the stock market - after inflation - is about 4%... so the fund eats a quarter of your earnings. (Vanguard's typical expense ratios are closer to 0.1-0.2%). If your company offers a tax-deferred retirement account such as a 401(k), you'll probably find it advantageous to use whatever funds that plan offers just to get the tax advantage, and roll over the account to a cheaper provider when you change employers. You can also buy mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) through most brokerages. E*Trade has a nice mutual fund screener, with over 6700 mutual funds and 1180 ETFs. Charles Schwab has one you can browse without even having an account.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Numerous institutions offer mutual funds; however, it's impractical to mention them all here. If you're undecided, consider Vanguard for its extremely low costs– this is a critical factor. An average expense ratio of 1% might seem insignificant until you understand that the stock market's annualized real rate of return, post inflation, is approximately 4%. Thus, the fund consumes about 25% of your returns (Note that Vanguard's typical expense ratios hover around 0.1-0.2%). If your employer provides a tax-deferred retirement account like a 401(k), it might be beneficial to invest in whatever funds that plan offers for the tax breaks. You can then transition the account to a more affordable provider when you switch jobs. Mutual funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are also purchasable through most brokerages.

      "Reference Response:  Personally, I avoid making business deals with friends and relatives. There's just too much of a possibility that things can go wrong.  Let's assume that you're honest people and you have no intention of cheating your mother-in-law. Still, all sorts of things could happen that could make it difficult for you to repay the loan. You could lose your job. You could get some big medical expense. Etc. Then what happens? Then your financial problems become family problems. There's a strong temptation when people borrow from relatives to make paying the loan the lowest priority in their budget. \"I know I promised to pay \\$X per month, but things are really tight right now and Mom should understand.\" Maybe she does understand and can manage without it. But maybe not. And then it becomes a family fight. \"You promised you'd pay it back.\" \"And we will, we're having a hard time right now. Can't you just give us a break?\" Etc. Or she might have some extra expense, and say, \"Hey, can't you pay a little more this month? I really need some extra cash.\" \"I'm sorry, we're struggling just to make the regular payments, we can't.\" \"Well I was willing to loan you all this money. The least you could do is pay me back when I need it.\" Etc. You can end up ruining family relationships over money. Your wife can find herself in the position of having to choose whether to side with her mother or her husband. Etc. I'm sure plenty of people do things like this and it works out just great. But there are big risks. And by the way, apparently this was your idea, not your mother-in-laws. I wonder what her reaction is. Is she eager to help out her daughter and son-in-law and had nothing in particular to do with the money anyway? Or is she feeling very imposed on? It's one thing to ask relatives to let you borrow their car for the weekend. Asking someone to loan you $50,000 is a very big request. If one of my kids asked me to loan them $50,000 from my retirement fund, I'd consider that a very presumptuous request. (Unless they needed the money for life-saving surgery for my grandchild or some such.)\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Personally, I steer clear of business transactions with friends and family due to the potential for complications. Take an example where you and your mother-in-law both have good intentions, and there's no intention of deception. Yet, unforeseen events, whether it's job loss or unexpected medical costs, could hinder your repayment ability. What then? Your financial issues morph into family troubles. When borrowing from relatives, it's often tempting to deprioritize loan reimbursement. \"We're facing financial stress right now, and Mom should understand,\" you might say. Maybe she does, maybe she doesn't. Either way, this could lead to intra-family disagreements. Statements like \"You said you'd repay it,\" and \"We are doing our best, why can't you be understanding?\" could threaten your familial relationship. She may also face financial stress and ask for additional repayment, starting another round of disagreements. Money-related tensions can ruin family bonds to the extent that your wife may have to choose between you and her mother. Making such transactions could be successful, but the risks are considerable. It also seems these suggestions are from your end, not your mother-in-law's. Her actual response to the offer could vary; she might be thrilled to help her daughter and son-in-law or she might feel taken for granted. A casual request to borrow a car from a relative isn't the same as asking for a huge loan. A request like that from my children, assuming it's not for a dire cause like a potentially life-saving operation for my grandchild, would certainly cross a line.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The safest investment in the United States is Treasures. The Federal Reserve just increased the short term rate for the first time in about seven years. But the banks are under no obligation to increase the rate they pay. So you (or rather they) can loan money directly to the United States Government by buying Bills, Notes, or Bonds. To do this you set up an account with Treasury Direct. You print off a form (available at the website) and take the filled out form to the bank. At the bank their identity and citizenship will be verified and the bank will complete the form. The form is then mailed into Treasury Direct.  There are at least two investments you can make at Treasury Direct that guarantee a rate of return better than the inflation rate. They are I-series bonds and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). Personally, I prefer the I-series bonds to TIPS.  Here is a link to the Treasury Direct website for information on I-series bonds. this link takes you to information on TIPS.  Edit: To the best of my understanding, the Federal Reserve has no ability to set the rate for notes and bonds. It is my understanding that they can only directly control the overnight rate. Which is the rate the banks get for parking their money with the Fed overnight. I believe that the rates for longer term instruments are set by the market and are not mandated by the Fed (or anyone else in government). It is only by indirect influence that the Fed tries to change long term rates.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  One of the safest financial ventures in the US pertains to Treasury assets. Since the Federal Reserve has raised the short term rate for the first time in about seven years. However, banks aren't compelled to hike their paid rates. Therefore, you (or more accurately, they) can lend money to the US Government by acquiring Bills, Notes, or Bonds directly. This is done by establishing an account with Treasury Direct. You will find a form on their website, which you fill out and bring to your bank. At the bank, they'll check your identity and citizenship before finalising the form. Afterwards, the form is sent to Treasury Direct. Among the available investments at Treasury Direct, I-series bonds and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) promise a return rate that outdoes inflation. Personally speaking, I find I-series bonds more appealing than TIPS. Here are links to the Treasury Direct website for details on I-series bonds, and for information on TIPS. As per my comprehension, the Federal Reserve doesn't possess the power to regulate the rates for notes and bonds. They can only directly influence the overnight rate, the rate banks secure when their money is parked with the Fed overnight. I am under the impression that the rates for long-dated instruments are market-driven and not decreed by the Fed (or any other government entity). Any attempts at adjusting long term rates by the Fed are through indirect methods.\n",

      "Reference Response:  TL;DR: The date they were granted.  (Usually, this follows both an offer and acceptance.) It's not uncommon for a new vesting clock to start when there's a new round of funding coming in, because the investors want to make sure the key people are going to be engaged and incentivized going forward from that point.  They don't lower their expectations for how long they want folks engaged based on the person having started earlier.  Non-institutional investors may have the same concerns as institutional investors here and use the same vesting strategy to address them. Primary recognition of the benefits from having had people start earlier or be there longer (so long as it correlates with having gotten more done) is embedded in the valuation (which affects how much founders' shares are diluted in the raise).\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  To sum it up: The allocation date is significant. Typically, this occurs after an offer and its acceptance. It's quite common for a new cycle of vesting to commence when fresh funds are injected as a result of new investors wanting to ensure that pivotal team members remain involved and motivated from this point on. They don't adjust their long-term involvement expectations even if the individual started earlier. Investors, whether institutional or not, may share these concerns and implement identical vesting procedures. The advantage of having personnel start earlier or stay longer (assuming it coincides with increased productivity) is reflected in the evaluation, which impacts the degree of dilution of the founders' shares during funding.\n",

      "Reference Response:  What are the options available for safe, short-term parking of funds? Savings accounts are the go-to option for safely depositing funds in a way that they remain accessible in the short-term. There are many options available, and any recommendations on a specific account from a specific institution depend greatly on the current state of banks. As you're in the US, If you choose to save funds in a savings account, it's important that you verify that the account (or accounts) you use are FDIC insured. Also be aware that the insurance limit is $250,000, so for larger volumes of money you may need to either break up your savings into multiple accounts, or consult a Accredited Investment Fiduciary (AIF) rather than random strangers on the internet. I received an inheritance check... Money is a token we exchange for favors from other people. As their last act, someone decided to give you a portion of their unused favors. You should feel honored that they held you in such esteem. I have no debt at all and aside from a few deferred expenses You're wise to bring up debt. As a general answer not geared toward your specific circumstances: Paying down debt is a good choice, if you have any. Investment accounts have an unknown interest rate, whereas reducing debt is guaranteed to earn you the interest rate that you would have otherwise paid. Creating new debt is a bad choice. It's common for people who receive large windfalls to spend so much that they put themselves in financial trouble. Lottery winners tend to go bankrupt. The best way to double your money is to fold it in half and put it back in your pocket. I am not at all savvy about finances... The vast majority of people are not savvy about finances. It's a good sign that you acknowledge your inability and are willing to defer to others. ...and have had a few bad experiences when trying to hire someone to help me Find an AIF, preferably one from a largish investment firm.

I am interested in options for safe, short \"parking\" of these funds until I figure out what I want to do.  Apart from savings accounts, some money market accounts and mutual funds may be appropriate for parking funds before investing elsewhere. They come with their own tradeoffs and are quite likely higher risk than you're willing to take while you're just deciding what to do with the funds. My personal recommendation* for your specific circumstances at this specific time is to put your money in an Aspiration Summit Account purely because it has 1% APY (which is the highest interest rate I'm currently aware of) and is FDIC insured. I am not affiliated with Aspiration. I would then suggest talking to someone at Vanguard or Fidelity about your investment options. Be clear about your expectations and don't be afraid to simply walk away if you don't like the advice you receive.

      "Paraphrased Response:  What are the possibilities for secure, short-duration fund placements? The primary choice for a safe store of money that remains easily reachable in the short term is a savings account. You'll find numerous choices at your disposal, with any advice on a particular account from a certain institution really depending heavily on the banking climate at the time. As you are located in the United States, ensure you confirm that the savings account(s) you use is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) if you decide to use one. Remember that the insurance cap is $250,000 so if you're dealing with larger sums, it might be necessary to split your savings into different accounts or seek advice from a Registered Investment Advisor instead of relying on casual online advice. I have been granted an inheritance... Currency is the means through which we trade favors with others. In their final act, someone opted to gift you some of their unspent favors. This decision to share with you should make you feel valued. I have zero debt and only a few postponed expenditures. It's prudent that you address the topic of debt. A general piece of advice, not particular to your situation, is that reducing debt is a good move if existent. Investments come with uncertain returns whilst reducing debt offers a guaranteed return in terms of the interest you would've paid. Acquiring new debt is not a wise decision. It's not unheard of for individuals who have stumbled upon a large amount of cash to splurge and find themselves in a financial conundrum. Lottery winners often face bankruptcy. The surefire strategy to grow your money is to fold it and secure it back in your wallet. I lack expertise in the financial field... Most people aren't financially literate. It's commendable that you are candid about your lack of understanding and are open to seeking help. I have had some unsuccessful instances when attempting to recruit help. Locate a registered investment advisor, preferably from a prominent investment company. There's no need to be their most highly valued client. It's sufficient for you to be treated respectfully and receive basic, solid financial advice. Don't shy away from exploring different options. I am looking into safe alternatives for short-term \"parking\" of this money until I decide on my next move. In addition to savings accounts, consider money market accounts and mutual funds as potential places to temporarily house funds before shifting them elsewhere. These come with their own compromises and may involve a risk level beyond your comfort zone. My personal opinion* at this moment, based on your specific situation, is to opt for an Aspiration Summit Account primarily due to its 1% APY (the maximum interest rate I'm presently aware of) and FDIC coverage. I have no connection to Aspiration. Afterward, I'd recommend discussing your investment possibilities with a representative from Vanguard or Fidelity. Make sure your expectations are apparent and never hesitate to exit if the advice given doesn't sit well with you.

In an annuity due, a deposit happens at the start of a time cycle, with the interest accrued given out at the cycle's end. This differentiates from a regular annuity where the payment is relinquished at the cycle's end. The formula's origin, resulting from induction, comes from the sum of the future values from each deposit. The primary value, inclusive of all accumulated interest across periods, can be effortlessly included. Consequently, the comprehensive equation is presented.\n",

      "Reference Response:  This is the S&P a bit over 20 years. If you've discovered a way to sell at 1400 in 2000, buy at 800 or so in 2003, sell again, well, you get the idea.  There's strong evidence the typical investor hears the S&P is making new highs and rushes in. It's this influx that may send stocks higher from here, until the smart money senses 'overbought' and bails.  I am not the smart money, but my ability to ignore emotion, and use asset allocation naturally had me selling a bit into each run up, and of course buying during downturns. Not all or none, and not with any perfect timing, just at year end when I'm rebalancing.  I am not a fan of short term timing, although I do respect Victor's observations and excellent example of when it's been shown to work.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Looking back over the past two decades at the S&P, imagine if you had found a strategy to sell at 1400 in the year 2000, buy when it dropped to around 800 in 2003, then sell again. Sounds nice, right? The reality is, most average investors get excited when they hear that the S&P is hitting new highs and quickly jump in. This surge of activity can potentially push the stock prices even higher until those in the know sense the market is 'overbought' and then exit. I may not be one of these savvy investors, but my knack for setting aside emotions and focusing on asset allocation has enabled me to sell a bit during each peak and naturally buy in during the lows. I don't do it all at once or claim to have impeccable timing, but more so when I balance out my portfolio at the end of each year. I may not endorse short-term timing, however, I can't ignore Victor's insightful views and impressive examples of when it has proven to be effective.\n",

Saving is investing is great, the earlier the better, and seeing retirement at a young age with smooth lots of life's troubles; saving is smart and we all know it. But as a college junior, be honest with yourself.  Don't you want to screw around and play with some of that money?  Your first time with real income, don't you want to blow it on a big TV, vacation, or computer? Budget out those items with realistic costs.  See the pros and cons of spending that money keeping in mind the opportunity cost.  For example, when I was in college, getting a new laptop for $2000 (!) was easily more important to me than retirement.  I don't regret that.  I do regret buying my new truck too soon and borrowing money to do it.  These are judgment calls. Here is the classic recipe: Adjust the numbers or businesses to your personal preferences.  I threw out suggestions so you can research them and get an idea of what to compare. And most importantly of all.  DO NOT GET INTO CREDIT CARD DEBT.  Use credit if you wish, but do not carry a balance.\n",

Yet, as a college undergraduate, be truthful to yourself. Shouldn't you want to have some fun and indulge in your earnings? When you receive your first substantial income, wouldn't you want to splurge on a large TV, holiday, or advanced computer? Allocate a realistic budget for such expenditures. Weigh up the advantages and drawbacks of such spending, bearing in mind the opportunity cost.

      "Paraphrased Response:  As you've mentioned, the concept of moving average, denoted by MA(k)t = (Pt-1 +... + Pt-k )/k, is a common technique used in technical analysis (TA) intended to mitigate the effects of fluctuating price movements. If there's a logical pattern, one might consider analyzing return series (Pt - Pt-1 / Pt-1) under the speculation that price trends are actually foreseeable and will fluctuate below and above a progressing moving average. Below, you'll find a link to a research paper published in the Journal of Finance examining moving average trading rules, which suggests evidence of prediction capabilities and anomalous returns via such methods. It's vital, however, when making decisions based on historical data, to be cautious of structural shifts and potential data mining. The paper, titled \"Simple technical trading rules and the stochastic properties of stock returns\" by Brock, W., J. Lakonishok, and B.

      "Reference Response:  Any ETF has expenses, including fees, and those are taken out of the assets of the fund as spelled out in the prospectus.  Typically a fund has dividend income from its holdings, and it deducts the expenses from the that income, and only the net dividend is passed through to the ETF holder.   In the case of QQQ, it certainly will have dividend income as it approximates a large stock index.  The prospectus shows that it will adjust daily the reported Net Asset Value (NAV) to reflect accrued expenses, and the cash to pay them will come from the dividend cash.  (If the dividend does not cover the expenses, the NAV will decline away from the modeled index.) Note that the NAV is not the ETF price found on the exchange, but is the underlying value.  The price tends to track the NAV fairly closely, both because investors don't want to overpay for an ETF or get less than it is worth, and also because large institutions may buy or redeem a large block of shares (to profit) when the price is out of line.  This will bring the price closer to that of the underlying asset (e.g. the NASDAQ 100 for QQQ) which is reflected by the NAV.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Every ETF incurs costs, comprising fees, which are deducted from the fund's assets as detailed in the prospectus. Ordinarily, a fund garners dividend earnings from its investments, and the costs are subtracted from these earnings; only the resulting dividend is distributed to the ETF holder. In the instance of QQQ, it's assured to generate dividend revenue because it mirrors a substantial stock index. The prospectus indicates that the documented Net Asset Value (NAV) will be updated daily to account for accumulated expenses, and the necessary funds to cover them will be sourced from the cash produced through dividends. Notably, if the dividends don't suffice to meet the costs, the NAV will deviate from the modelled index. Be aware that NAV isn't the ETF price visible on the stock exchange, but the intrinsic value of the ETF. The ETF price habitually correlates fairly accurately with the NAV, mostly because investors prefer not to overpay for an ETF or sell it for less than its worth, and large institutions might purchase or return a major block of shares for profit if the price becomes misaligned. This tends to align the price more accurately with the value of the ETF's underlying asset (like the NASDAQ 100 for QQQ), as represented by its NAV.\n",

      "Reference Response:  On the face, this appears a sound method to manage long run cumulative interest, but there are some caveats. Maxing out credit cards will destroy your credit rating.  You will receive no more reasonable offers for credit, only shady ones.  Though your credit rating will rise the moment you bring the balance back down to 10%, even with high income, it's easy to overshoot the 8 months, and then a high interest rate kicks in because of the low credit rating. Further, maxing out credit cards will encourage credit card lenders to begin cutting limits and at worse demand early payment. Now, after month 6 hits, your financial payment obligations skyrocket.  A sudden jolt is never easy to manage.  This will increase risk of missing a payment, a disaster for such hair line financing. In short, the probability of decimating your financial structure is high for very little benefit. If you are confident that you can pay off $4,000 in 8 months then simply apply those payments to the student loan directly, cutting out the middle man.  Your creditors will be pleased to see your total liabilities fall at a high rate while your utilization remains small, encouraging them to offer you more credit and lower rates. The ideal credit card utilization rate is 10%, so it would be wise to use that portion to repay the student loans. Building up credit will allow you to use the credit as an auxiliary cushion when financial disaster strikes.  Keeping an excellent credit rating will allow you to finance the largest home possible for your money.  Every percentage point of mortgage interest can mean the difference between a million USD home and a $750,000 one.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  At first glance, this might seem like an effective technique for handling long-term accumulated interest, but it's not without its drawbacks. Depleting your credit cards can result in serious damage to your credit score. Subsequently, you will no longer receive any decent credit offers, just questionable ones. Even though your credit score may rebound once you reduce the balance to 10%, you might easily exceed the 8-month timeframe due to high income, triggering the application of a high-interest rate due to the poor credit score. Moreover, maxing out your credit cards prompts credit card companies to start reducing limits and even demand premature payment. After the 6th month, your financial obligations hit a peak. Unexpected spikes are always hard to deal with, increasing the likelihood of missing a payment - a catastrophe for such delicate finance planning. Summarily, the risk of sabotage to your financial framework is significant for minimal gain. If you're sure that you can repay $4,000 in 8 months, it would be much more effective to pay that money directly to the student loan bypassing any intermediaries. Creditors would appreciate seeing your overall debt decrease rapidly while your use of credit stays modest, compelling them to present you with additional credit and lower interest rates. The optimal credit card utilization ratio is 10%, hence it is suggested to use that fraction for student loan repayment. Boosting your credit would serve as extra financial security should an unexpected crisis occur. Maintaining a stellar credit score paves the way for securing the most housing for your money. Each percentage point in mortgage interest could be the difference between possessing a million-dollar house or a $750,000 one.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I would tell the former owner that you will sell him the house for you current loan balance. He wants the home, he may be willing to pay what you owe. You can't really do a short sale unless you are behind on your payments. Banks only agree to a short sale when they think they are going to have to foreclose on the property. Not to mention a short sale is almost as bad as a foreclosure and will wreck your credit. If the former buying is not willing to buy the house for what you owe your only real option is to come up with the difference. If he offers you say $50K less than you owe, you will have to give the mortgage holder the remaining balance $50K in this example for them to release the property.  Another problem you will face, if the former owner is willing to pay more than what the house is worth, and he is going to finance it, he will have to have enough cash to put down so that the loan amount is not more than the property is worth. Finally if none of that works you can just hold on to the property until the value comes up or you mortgage is payed down enough to make the balance of the mortgage less than the value of the house. Then offer the property to the former owner again.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  You could suggest to the previous owner that you're prepared to sell the house at the cost equivalent to your current loan balance. If he's keen on obtaining the property, he might be open to settling the amount you're indebted with. However, a short sale isn't feasible unless you're lagging in your payments. Financial institutions only consider short sales if they foresee a foreclosure situation. Remember, a short sale is nearly as detrimental as foreclosure and will substantially impact your credit. In cases where the former owner is reluctant to purchase the house for the amount you owe, your only viable choice is to close in on the difference. For instance, if you're offered $50K less than what you owe, you're obligated to pay the leftover balance of $50K to the mortgage holder for them to relinquish the property. You may hit another snag if the previous owner is ready to pay over the market value, and wants to finance the purchase. He will need to have sufficient cash for the down payment to ensure that the loan sum doesn't exceed the property's actual worth. If all else fails, you can retain the property until its value appreciates, or your mortgage has sufficiently reduced that it is lower than the house's value. Then, you could propose selling the property to the previous owner once again.\n",

      "Reference Response:  An investment portfolio is typically divided into three components: All three of those can be accessed through mutual funds or ETFs. A 401(k) will probably have a small set of mutual funds for you to pick from. Mutual funds may charge you silly expenses if you pick a bad one. Look at the prospectus for the expense ratio. If it's over 1% you're definitely paying too much. If it's over 0.5% you're probably paying too much. If it's less than 0.1% you have a really good deal. US stocks are generally the core holding until you move into retirement (or get close to spending the money on something else if it's not invested for retirement). International stocks are riskier than US stocks, but provide opportunity for diversification and better returns than the US stocks. Bonds, or fixed-income investments, are generally very safe, but have limited opportunities for returns. They tend to do better when stocks are doing poorly. When you've got a while to invest, you should be looking at riskier investments; when you don't, you should be looking for safer investments. A quick (and rough) rule of thumb is that \"your age should match the portion of your portfolio in bonds\". So if you're 50 years old and approaching retirement in 15 years or so, you should have about 50% in bonds. Roughly.  People whose employment and future income is particularly tied to one sector of the market would also do well to avoid investing there, because they already are at risk if it performs badly. For instance, if you work in the technology sector, loading up on tech stocks is extra risky: if there's a big bust, you're not just out of a job, your portfolio is dead as well. More exotic options are available to diversify a portfolio: While many portfolios could benefit from these sorts of holdings, they come with their own advantages and disadvantages and should be researched carefully before taking a significant stake in them.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  An investment portfolio is usually split into three parts that can be accessed via mutual funds or ETFs. Usually, a 401(k) offers a limited range of mutual funds to choose from. Beware of choosing a poor mutual fund as they can levy unnecessary fees. You can check the expense ratio in the prospectus - if it exceeds 1%, it's excessive; if it's over 0.5%, it's likely too high; if it's under 0.1%, it's a fantastic deal. Until retirement approaches, or until you need to spend the money elsewhere if it's not intended for retirement, US stocks are usually the main investment. While international stocks carry more risk than US stocks, they also offer the possibility for diversification and potentially higher returns. Bonds, or fixed-income investments, are generally very safe, but their return potential is limited. They typically perform well when stocks are not. When you have plenty of time to invest, take a look at riskier investments; if not, safer investments are the way to go. A basic (and loose) guideline to follow is: \"Your age should correspond with the percentage of your portfolio in bonds\". Therefore, if you're 50 years old and about 15 years away from retirement, you should have roughly 50% in bonds. Particularly if an individual's employment and future earnings are closely linked to a specific market sector, they would benefit from not investing in that sector due to the added risk if the sector underperforms. For example, if you're employed in the tech sector, heavily investing in tech stocks increases your risk: a major downturn could cost both your job and your investment portfolio. Other more unique investment choices are available to diversify a portfolio: Whilst many portfolios might profit from such investments, they come with their own upsides and downsides and should be scrutinised thoroughly before making a substantial investment.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Depends on how far down the market is heading, how certain you are that it is going that way, when you think it will fall, and how risk-averse you are.  By \"better\" I will assume you are trying to make the most money with this information that you can given your available capital. If you are very certain, the way that makes the most money for the least investment from the options you provided is a put.  If you can borrow some money to buy even more puts, you will make even more.  Use your knowledge of how far and when the market will fall to determine which put is optimal at today's prices.  But remember that if the market stays flat or goes up you lose everything you put in and may owe extra to your creditor.  A short position in a futures contract is also an easy way to get extreme leverage.  The extremity of the leverage will depend on how much margin is required.  Futures trade in large denominations, so think about how much you are able to put to risk. The inverse ETFs are less risky and offer less reward than the derivative contracts above.  The levered one has twice the risk and something like twice the reward.  You can buy those without a margin account in a regular cash brokerage, so they are easier in that respect and the transactions cost will likely be lower. Directly short selling an ETF or stock is another option that is reasonably accessible and only moderately risky.  On par with the inverse ETFs.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Your decision hinges on your understanding of the market's trajectory, your confidence in this prediction, your estimation of when a dip will occur, and your tolerance for financial risks. I'm assuming by \"better\" you're looking to maximize financial gain based on this information, considering your available funds. If you're highly confident, the most lucrative strategy requiring the least investment from your given options is to purchase a put. If possible, borrowing money to acquire more puts can amplify your profits. Use your predictions on the timing and magnitude of the market dip to identify the most beneficial put when considering current rates. However, bear in mind, if the market remains stable or rises, you stand to lose your original investment and possibly owe additional debt to your lender. Opting for a short position in a futures contract can also provide substantial leverage. The degree of leverage will be determined by the required margin. As futures are traded in considerable amounts, contemplate your capacity for bearing financial risk. Inverse ETFs bearless risk and offer smaller rewards compared to the aforementioned derivative contracts. A levered one poses double the risk but potentially offers approximately double the reward. These can be purchased without a margin account in an everyday cash brokerage, rendering them relatively straightforward, with potentially lower transaction costs.

It basically said: 1 - I never signed anything. 2 - I spoke to a very aggressive person at the airport who told me that she was just taking down my information in order to send information about the card, and that I was under no obligation 3 - I never received a card, activated a card, or used a card. 4 - I want this charge canceled immediately  5 - If this ever shows up on my credit report, I will contact my lawyer regarding this unscrupulous business practice. After that I received a notice in the mail confirming that everything had been cancelled and all charges were reversed.\n",

Following some initially unsuccessful endeavours, I decided to pen a note and dispatched copies to the card services, customer helpdesk, complaints, and legal divisions.

(2) I had a conversation with an overly assertive individual at the airport who assured me she was merely noting down my details to mail card-related information, asserting that I held no commitment. (3) I didn't get, activate, or utilize any card. (4) I insist on the immediate cancellation of this charge. (5) If it appears on my credit record, I'll consult my attorney concerning this unfair business conduct.

      "Reference Response:  When you buy a futures contract you are entering into an agreement to buy gold, in the future (usually a 3 month settlement date).  this is not an OPTION, but a contract, so each party is taking risk, the seller that the price will rise, the buyer that the price will fall.  Unlike an option which you can simply choose not to exercise if the price goes down, with futures you are obligated to follow through. (or sell the contract to someone else, or buy it back)  The price you pay depends on the margin, which is related to how far away the settlement date is, but you can expect around 5% , so the minimum you could get into is 100 troy ounces, at todays price, times 5%.  Since we're talking about 100 troy ounces, that means the margin required to buy the smallest sized future contract would be about the same as buying 5 ounces of gold.  roughly $9K at current prices. If you are working through a broker they will generally require you to sell or buy back the contract before the settlement date as they don't want to deal with actually following through on the purchase and having to take delivery of the gold.  How much do you make or lose? Lets deal with a smaller change in the price, to be a bit more realistic since we are talking typically about a settlement date that is 3 months out. And to make the math easy lets bump the price of gold to $2000/ounce.  That means the price of a futures contract is going to be $10K   Lets say the price goes up 10%,  Well you have basically a 20:1 leverage since you only paid 5%, so you stand to gain $20,000. Sounds great right?  WRONG.. because as good as the upside is, the downside is just as bad.  If the price went down 10% you would be down $20000, which means you would not only have to cough up the 10K you committed but you would be expected to 'top up the margin' and throw in  ANOTHER $10,000 as well.  And if you can't pay that up your broker might close out your position for you. oh and if the price hasn't changed, you are mostly just out the fees and commissions you paid to buy and sell the contract.  With futures contracts you can lose MORE than your original investment.  NOT for the faint of heart or the casual investor.  NOT for folks without large reserves who can afford to take big losses if things go against them.  I'll close this answer with a quote from the site I'm linking below The large majority of people who trade futures lose their money.   That's a fact. They lose even when they are right in the medium term,   because futures are fatal to your wealth on an unpredicted and   temporary price blip. Now consider that, especially the bit about 'price blip' and then look at the current volatility of most markets right now, and I think you can see how futures trading can be as they say 'Fatal to your Wealth' (man, I love that phrase, what a great way of putting it)  This Site has a pretty decent primer on the whole thing. their view is perhaps a bit biased due to the nature of their business, but on the whole their description of how things work is pretty decent.  Investopedia has a more detailed (and perhaps more objective) tutorial on the futures thing.  Well worth your time if you think you want to do anything related to the futures market.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Investing in a futures contract signifies committing to purchase gold at a specified future date, typically 3 months out, not an option. This implies that both parties involved are taking on risk - the seller risks the price going up whereas the buyer takes a gamble on the price dropping. Contrary to an option where you are free not to exercise if the price drops, with futures, you are bound to fulfill the contract unless you can sell the contract to another person or buy it back. The cost is usually around 5% and is dependent on the margin, which relates to the distance of the settlement date. So, the smallest entry point becomes 100 troy ounces, with today's rate multiplied by 5%. Consequently, the margin for securing the smallest future contract – based on 100 troy ounces – equates to buying about 5 ounces of gold, which is around $9K at today's prices. If transacting through a broker, you'll generally be required to sell or buy back the contract before the settlement date to avoid the hassle of physically acquiring the gold. So, what's the potential gain or loss? Let's consider a smaller price change and assume the gold price is $2000/ounce making a futures contract $10K. If the price increases by 10%, you could profit $20,000 due to a leverage of 20:1. But, if the price decreases by 10%, you'd lose $20,000. Hence, you would have to provide the committed $10K and an additional $10K to cover the margin. If you don't have the funds, your broker may liquidate your position. With futures contracts, your losses might exceed your initial investment, which isn't advisable for risk-averse or inexperienced investors or those with limited reserves. As noted on the shared website, the majority of futures traders end up losing money. This often happens despite accurate medium-term predictions due to sudden temporary price fluctuation that can greatly impact wealth. Given the current level of market volatility, futures trading can be detrimental to wealth. The included websites provide valuable insights about futures if you're considering delving into this market.\n",

      "Reference Response:  One thing I would like to clear up here is that Black Scholes is just a model that makes some assumptions about the dynamics of the underlying + a few other things and with some rather complicated math, out pops the Black Scholes formula. Black Scholes gives you the \"real\" price under the assumptions of the model. Your definition of what a \"real\" price entails will depend on what assumptions you make. With that being said, Black Scholes is popular for pricing European options because of the simplicity and speed of using an analytic formula as opposed to having a more complex model that can only be evaluated using a numerical method, as DumbCoder mentioned (should note that, for many other types of derivative contracts, e.g. American or Bermudan style exercise, the Black Scholes analytic formula is not appropriate). The other important thing to note here is that the market does not necessarily need to agree with the assumptions made in the Black Scholes model (and they most certainly do not) to use it. If you look at implied vols for a set of options which have the same expiration but differing strike prices, you may find that the implied vols for each contract differ and this information is telling you to what degree the traders in the market for those contracts disagree with the lognormal distribution assumption made by Black Scholes. Implied vol is generally the thing to look at when determining cheapness/expensiveness of an option contract. With all that being said, what I'm assuming you are interested in is either called a \"delta-gamma approximation\" or more generally \"Greek/sensitivities based profit and loss attribution\" (in case you wanted to Google some more about it). Here is an example that is relevant to your question. Let's say we had the following European call contract: Popping this in to BS formula gives you a premium of $4.01, delta of 0.3891 and gamma of 0.0217. Let's say you bought it, and the price of the stock immediately moves to 55 and nothing else changes, re-evaluating with the BS formula gives ~6.23. Whereas using a delta-gamma approximation gives: The actual math doesn't work out exactly and that is due to the fact that there are higher order Greeks than gamma but as you can see here clearly they do not have much of an impact considering a 10% move in the underlying is almost entirely explained by delta and gamma.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I wish to clarify that the Black Scholes model is primarily a construct laden with assumptions regarding the inner workings of the underlying plus a few additional elements. Employing rather complex mathematics gives rise to the Black Scholes equation. This model delivers what you might consider the \"true\" cost under the constraints of the said model. How you interpret the notion of a \"genuine\" price relies heavily on the assumptions you choose to adopt. On that note, the Black Scholes formula’s popularity for pricing European options derives from the ease and promptness of computing with an analytic formula versus a more intricate model that necessitates a numerical solution, as mentioned by DumbCoder. It's also worth noting that for a variety of other derivative contracts, like American or Bermudan style exercise, the Black Scholes analytic formula isn't suitable. Something else to remember is that the market doesn’t necessarily adhere to the Black Scholes model’s assumptions, despite its use. By examining the implied volatility for a set of options with identical expiration but varying strike rates, you may discover that each contract’s implied volatility varies. This indicator signifies how much those trading these contracts dispute the lognormal distribution supposition put forth by Black Scholes. It's typically the implied volatility that's scrutinized to ascertain an option contract's relative value. That said, what you're probably curious about is either a \"delta-gamma approximation\" or more broadly, \"Greek/sensitivities based profit and loss attribution\" — terms you might want to look up for further understanding. Assume we have a European call contract like this: Inputting this into the Black Scholes formula produces a premium of $4.01, a delta of 0.3891, and a gamma of 0.0217. If you purchased it and the stock price immediately jumped to 55 with all else remaining constant, re-calculation with the Black Scholes equation gives ~6.23. Although the delta-gamma approximation provides a slightly different result, the real difference is very small. Due to higher order Greeks than gamma, the actual mathematics don’t completely align. However, even if underlyings shift by 10%, delta and gamma almost entirely account for the change, illustrating their minor impact.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Yes, the newly bought shares will have a long-term holding period, regardless of when you sell them.  In addition, it's only a wash sale if you sold the first shares for a loss; it's not a wash sale if you sold them for a gain. Wikipedia mentions this: When a wash sale occurs, the holding period for the replacement stock includes the period you held the stock you sold. Example: You've held shares of XYZ for 10 years. You sell it at a loss but then buy it back within the wash sale period. When you sell the replacement stock, your gain or loss will be long-term — no matter how soon you sell it. Charles Schwab also mentions this: Here's a quick example of a wash sale. On 9/30/XX, you buy 500 shares of ABC at $10 per share. One year later the stock price starts to drop, and you sell all your shares at $9 per share on 10/4/XY. Two days later, on 10/6, ABC bottoms out at $8 and you buy 500 shares again. This series of trades triggers a wash sale. The holding period of the original shares will be added to the holding period of the replacement shares, effectively leaving you with a long-term position.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Indeed, the stocks you've recently acquired will maintain their long-term status, irrespective of the selling date. Plus, it only counts as a wash sale if the initial shares were sold at a loss; selling them at a profit doesn't qualify it as a wash sale. As stated by Wikipedia: a wash sale's timeline incorporates the duration you held the previous stock. For instance, if you've had XYZ shares for a decade, and you offload them at a loss but repurchase within the wash sale timeframe, when you let go of this newly acquired stock, the profit or loss will be long-term, regardless of the urgency of the sale. This concept is also addressed by Charles Schwab, illustrating it with an example: you buy 500 units of ABC on 9/30/XX at a rate of $10 per unit. A year down the line, the stock begins to decline, prompting you to sell your entire stake at $9 per share on 10/4/XY. Two days later, ABC hits rock bottom at $8, prompting you to buy 500 units again. This succession of transactions initiates a wash sale. The holding timeline of the primary shares will be consolidated with the holding timeline of the replacement shares, eventually earning you a spot in a long-term position.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Not all call options that have value at expiration, exercise by purchasing the security (or attempting to, with funds in your account).   On ETNs, they often (always?) settle in cash.  As an example of an option I'm currently looking at, AVSPY, it settles in cash (please confirm by reading the documentation on this set of options at http://www.nasdaqomxtrader.com/Micro.aspx?id=Alpha, but it is an example of this).  There's nothing it can settle into (as you can't purchase the AVSPY index, only options on it).  You may quickly look (wikipedia) at the difference between \"American Style\" options and \"European Style\" options, for more understanding here. Interestingly I just spoke to my broker about this subject for a trade execution.  Before I go into that, let me also quickly refer to Joe's answer:  what you buy, you can sell.  That's one of the jobs of a market maker, to provide liquidity in a market.  So, when you buy a stock, you can sell it.  When you buy an option, you can sell it.  That's at any time before expiration (although how close you do it before the closing bell on expiration Friday/Saturday is your discretion).  When a market maker lists an option price, they list a bid and an ask.  If you are willing to sell at the bid price, they need to purchase it (generally speaking).  That's why they put a spread between the bid and ask price, but that's another topic not related to your question -- just note the point of them buying at the bid price, and selling at the ask price -- that's what they're saying they'll do. Now, one major difference with options vs. stocks is that options are contracts. So, therefore, we can note just as easily that YOU can sell the option on something (particularly if you own either the underlying, or an option deeper in the money).  If you own the underlying instrument/stock, and you sell a CALL option on it, this is a strategy typically referred to as a covered call, considered a \"risk reduction\" strategy.  You forfeit (potential) gains on the upside, for money you receive in selling the option. The point of this discussion is, is simply: what one buys one can sell;  what one sells one can buy -- that's how a \"market\" is supposed to work.  And also, not to think that making money in options is buying first, then selling.  It may be selling, and either buying back or ideally that option expiring worthless. -- Now, a final example.  Let's say you buy a deep in the money call on a stock trading at $150, and you own the $100 calls.  At expiration, these have a value of $50.  But let's say, you don't have any money in your account, to take ownership of the underlying security (you have to come up with the additional $100 per share you are missing).  In that case, need to call  your broker and see how they handle it, and it will depend on the type of account you have (e.g. margin or not, IRA, etc).  Generally speaking though, the \"margin department\" makes these decisions, and they look through folks that have options on things that have value, and are expiring, and whether they have the funds in their account to absorb the security they are going to need to own.  Exchange-wise, options that have value at expiration, are exercised.  But what if the person who has the option, doesn't have the funds to own the whole stock? Well, ideally on Monday they'll buy all the shares with the options you have at the current price, and immediately liquidate the amount you can't afford to own, but they don't have to.  I'm mentioning this detail so that it helps you see what's going or needs to go on with exchanges and brokerages and individuals, so you have a broader picture.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Not every call option that holds value upon expiration involves purchasing the security (assuming you have funds available). On Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs), settlement is commonly in cash. To illustrate, one such option is AVSPY, which settles in cash (kindly verify this by going over the documentation on this set of options at http://www.nasdaqomxtrader.com/Micro.aspx?id=Alpha). There's nothing to settle into since you can't buy the AVSPY index, only its options. I recommend a quick review of the difference between \"American Style\" and \"European Style\" options (you could use wikipedia as a source) to improve your understanding of the matter. Notably, in a recent conversation with my broker about this subject, he reminded me of an essential truth: whatever you buy, you can sell - a crucial role of a market maker in facilitating liquidity. So, whether you've purchased a stock or an option, you retain the power to sell it before its expiration (the timing of which is at your discretion). Market makers will list a bid and an ask when pricing an option. If you're willing to sell at the bid price, they're obligated to buy it (typically). They place a spread between the bid and ask prices for a reason, although exploring that is not relevant to the current topic. It's important to note, however, that the dynamics change somewhat when dealing with options versus stocks, since options are contracts. Therein lies the opportunity for you to sell the option, especially if you own the underlying asset or a deeper in the money option. This approach, often called a covered call, is considered a risk mitigation strategy. It comes with a trade-off, though, where you might miss potential upsides for the surety of the money you get from the option sale. The takeaway here is that markets should allow free trade - purchases can be sold, and vice versa. Further, profiting from options doesn't necessarily mean buying then selling. It could involve selling and then buying back, or ideally leaving the option to lose its value. In a final example, suppose you've gone for a call deep in the money on a stock priced at $150, and you have the $100 calls. These would be worth $50 upon expiration. But if you can't afford to acquire the underlying security (you need an extra $100 per share), you'll need to reach out to your broker. Your account type (margin, IRA, and so forth) may affect their decision. Usually, the margin department runs the show, keeping an eye out for valuable expiring options and whether the account holders can manage the securities. Options with value at expiration are supposed to be exercised. What if the option holder can't afford the full security? Ideally, they can buy the shares and immediately sell the ones they can't afford. \n",

      "Reference Response:  I'm another programmer, I guess we all just like complicated things, or got here via stackoverflow. Obligatory tedious but accurate point: Investing is not personal finance, in fact it's maybe one of the less important parts of it. See this answer: Where to start with personal finance?  Obligatory warning for software developer type minds: getting into investing because it's complicated and therefore fun is a really awful idea from a financial perspective.  Or see behavioral finance research on how analytical/professional/creative type people are often terrible at investing, while even-tempered practical people are better. The thing with investing is that inaction is better than action, tried and true is better than creative, and simple is better than complicated. So if you're like me and many programmers and like creative, complicated action - not good for the wallet. You've been warned. That said. :-) Stuff I read In general I hate reading too much financial information because I think it makes me take ill-advised actions. The actions I most need to take have to do with my career and my spending patterns. So I try to focus on reading about software development, for example. Or I answer questions on this site, which at least might help someone out, and I enjoy writing. For basic financial news and research, I prefer Morningstar.com, especially if you get the premium version. The writing has more depth, it's often from qualified financial analysts, and with the paid version you get data and analysis on thousands of funds and stocks, instead of a small number as with Motley Fool newsletters. I don't follow Morningstar regularly anymore, instead I use it for research when I need to pick funds in a 401k or whatever. Another caveat on Morningstar is that the \"star ratings\" on funds are dumb. Look at the Analyst Picks and the analyst writeups instead. I just flipped through my RSS reader and I have 20-30 finance-related blogs in there collecting unread posts. It looks like the only one I regularly read is http://alephblog.com/ which is sort of random. But I find David Merkel very thoughtful and interesting. He's also a conservative without being a partisan hack, and posts frequently. I read the weekly market comment at http://hussmanfunds.com/ as well. Most weeks it says the market is overvalued, so that's predictable, but the interesting part is the rationale and the other ideas he talks about. I read a lot of software-related blogs and there's some bleed into finance, especially from the VC world; blogs like http://www.avc.com/ or http://bhorowitz.com/ or whatever. Anyway I spend most of my reading time on career-related stuff and I think this is also the correct decision from a financial perspective. If you were a doctor, you'd be better off reading about doctoring, too. I read finance-related books fairly often, I guess there are other threads listing ideas on that front. I prefer books about principles rather than a barrage of daily financial news and questionable ideas. Other than that, I keep up with headlines, just reading the paper every day including business-related topics is good enough. If there's some big event in the financial markets, it'll show up in the regular paper. Take a class I initially learned about finance by reading a pile of books and alongside that taking the CFP course and the first CFA course. Both are probably equivalent to about a college semester worth of work, but you can plow through them in a couple months each if you focus. You can just do the class (and take the exam if you like), without having to go on and actually get the work experience and the certifications. I didn't go on to do that. This sounds like a crazy thing to do, and it kind of is, but I think it's also sort of crazy to expect to be competent on a topic without taking some courses or otherwise getting pretty deep into the material. If you're a normal person and don't have time to take finance courses, you're likely better off either keeping it super-simple, or else outsourcing if you can find the right advisor: What exactly can a financial advisor do for me, and is it worth the money?  When it's inevitably complex (e.g. as you approach retirement) then an advisor is best. My mom is retiring soon and I found her a professional, for example. I like having a lot of knowledge myself, because it's just the only way I could feel comfortable. So for sure I understand other people wanting to have it too. But what I'd share from the other side is that once you have it, the conclusion is that you don't have enough knowledge (or time) to do anything fancy anyway, and that the simple answers are fine. Check out http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Simple-Financial-Strategies-People/dp/0743269942 Investing for fun isn't investing for profit Many people recommend Motley Fool (I see two on this question already!). The site isn't evil, but the problem (in my opinion) is that it promotes an attitude toward and a style of investing that isn't objectively justifiable for practical reasons. Essentially I don't think optimizing for making money and optimizing for having fun coexist very well. If investing is your chosen hobby rather than fishing or knitting, then Motley Fool can be fun with their tone and discussion forums, but other people in forums are just going to make you go wrong money-wise; see behavioral finance research again. Talking to others isn't compatible with ice in your decision-making veins. Also, Motley Fool tends to pervasively make it sound like active investing is easier than it is. There's a reason the Chartered Financial Analyst curriculum is a few reams of paper plus 4 years of work experience, rather than reading blogs. Practical investing (\"just buy the target date fund\") can be super easy, but once you go beyond that, it's not. I don't really agree with the \"anyone can do it and it's not work!\" premise, any more than I think that about lawyering or doctoring or computer programming. After 15 years I'm a programming expert; after some courses and a lot of reading, I'm not someone who could professionally run an actively-managed portfolio. I think most of us need to have the fun part separate from the serious cash part. Maybe literally distinct accounts that you keep at separate brokerages. Or just do something else for fun, besides investing. Morningstar has this problem too, and finance.yahoo.com, and Bloomberg, I mean, they are all interested in making you think about investing a lot more than you ought to. They all have an incentive to convince you that the latest headlines make a difference, when they don't. Bottom line, I don't think personal finance changes very quickly; the details of specific mutual funds change, and there's always some new twist in the tax code, but the big picture is pretty stable. I think going in-depth (say, read the Chartered Financial Analyst curriculum materials) would teach you a lot more than reading blogs frequently. The most important things to work on are income (career) and spending (to maximize income minus spending). That's where time investment will pay off. I know it's annoying to argue the premise of the question rather than answering, but I did try to mention a couple things to read somewhere in there ;-)\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Despite being a programmer myself, I've come to understand that investing shouldn't be approached as if it's another complex coding puzzle.

      "\n",
      "First and foremost, investing isn't synonymous with personal finance, but is merely a small segment of it. Attempting to profit from investments simply because it's a complex game does not necessarily result in financial success. Surprisingly, practical and even-minded individuals often fare better at investing compared to analytical or creative thinkers, since decisiveness isn't as fruitful as patience and simplicity in this context. Therefore, those who cherish creativity and complexity might find that their wallets don't enjoy it as much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding investment literature and resources, I'd caution against indulging excessively. Overfeeding on financial information often leads me to make inopportune decisions. Instead of focusing on these, my priorities lie with advancing my career and managing my expenses – areas where I can make a real financial impact.

      "Despite having numerous finance-related blogs in my RSS reader, I primarily visit http://alephblog.com/, finding David Merkel's approach refreshing and insightful. Occasionally, I also take a peek at the weekly market comment on http://hussmanfunds.com/. Given that my career is rooted in the software industry, I tend to visit finance-related blogs that overlap with my field. Reading up on my career-related topics is, I believe, financially rational. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of finance-related books, I prefer those grounded on principles rather than those sharing an influx of everyday financial news. Similarly, even though I keep abreast of major financial events, my prime focus remains my career and managing spending habits. \n",
      "\n",
      "In an unavoidable complex financial scenario, such as nearing retirement, seeking advice from a financial advisor could be valuable. Based on my own experience, having knowledge gave me confidence, but it was simultaneously enlightening to understand that complexity wasn't necessary for financial success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many vouch for Motley Fool, but I feel their method of investing conflicts with my practical outlook. It's enjoyable, undoubtedly, but doesn't align with profiting goals. From my perspective, active investing isn't as simple as many platforms make it out to be. A competent understanding of the investment field requires thorough coursework and years of experience – much like expertise in any professional field. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the day, it's vital to remember that personal finance doesn't alter rapidly. While the intricacies of mutual funds and tax regulations vary, the broader picture remains steady.

He takes this and generates $1 profit from it, recovering the $9 which he then reinvests to generate $1 profit every day.  From your perspective, you just gave him $9.  At the end of the year, he gives you $365 in addition to your original investment of $9 (in real life he'd take the fees of course, or perhaps he's been lending out the money he's been accumulating and taking the interest from that as pay for his services).  So your return on investment is 365 / 9 * 100 % > 4000 %, as claimed by your source.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The previous responses aren't incorrect, but here's a method that could make it completely clear to you. Picture you're not the person executing the business model, but you delegate it to someone else. Consider this other individual your investment handler. Thus, on day one, you entrust $9 to your investment handler. He capitalizes on this to earn $1 profit daily while maintaining the $9 to reinvest and continue making $1 each day. From your standpoint, you've given him only $9. By year's end, he hands over $365 in profit plus your original $9 (though he'd surely take a commission in real scenarios, or perhaps he's been loaning the accumulating funds and earning the interest as his service fee). Thus, the yield on your investment equates to 365 / 9 * 100 %, which is over 4000%, as stated by your reference.\n",

      "Reference Response:  You probably won't get a mortgage. UDSA has a 41% ratio of monthly debt to monthly income limit, and a score of 660 or better. A 250,000 mortgage at current rates for 30 year mortgage is about $1560/mo. (included in this figure is the 1% mortgage insurance premium, the .4% annual fee, the current rate for a 660 credit rating, the 2% points fee added at the front of the mortgage, typical closing cost added to transaction, and the .5% fee for over-mortgage insurance for the first 3 years since your mortgage will be higher than the value of the house due to these additional fees) Credit card payments = $120 ($60 times 2) Car payments = $542 ($271 for your car, $271 for the car you will be getting) Student loan = $50/month Child Support = $500/month Total = $2772/month Your income per month is 82000/12 = $6833/month $2772/$6833 = 40.6%...  This is awfully close to the limit, so they likely would also look at your ability to save.  Not seeing savings in the above example, I assume it is low.  USDA site One mortgage help site breaks down some of the requirements into layman's language. Not knowing your exact location (county/state) and how many children you have, it is hard to be sure whether you make too much to qualify.  This link shows the income limits by number of people in the house and the county/state.  There are few places in which you could be living that would qualify you to any of their programs unless you have a several children. As others have posted, I suggest you get your debt down.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Obtaining a mortgage may be a challenge for you. UDSA stipulates a maximum monthly debt to monthly income ratio of 41% and requires a credit score of 660 or higher. If you were to seek a mortgage of $250,000 with present rates for a 30-year term, you'd be looking at approximately $1560 per month. This calculation also factors in the 1% mortgage insurance premium, 0.4% annual fee, current rates for a 660 credit score, 2% front-end points fee, standard closing costs and 0.5% extra mortgage insurance for the initial three years as your mortgage exceeds the home's value because of these added costs. Your monthly outgoings include credit card payments of $120, car payments of $542, a $50 student loan payment and $500 for child support- a total of $2772 each month. Given a monthly income of $6833 (annual income of $82000 divided by 12), your debt-to-income ratio is approximately 40.6%, dangerously near the acceptance limit. Therefore, they'll likely examine your saving habits and, based off the example, I presume your savings are minimal. The USDA and several mortgage assist platforms simplify the requirements in non-technical terms. Without awareness of your exact location and number of dependents, it's difficult to be certain whether your income oversteps the qualification limit. This link provides county and state-wise income qualifications based on household size. Unless you have many children, there are limited locations in which you would fulfill their program criteria. Following suggestions from others, I would advise reducing your debt.\n",

      "Reference Response:  If your father is still able to make financial decisions and sign contracts, I see a better option. Have your father borrow against his equity to finance the renovation.  Example: the house is worth 400 now. He can borrow 100 against that. He spends it on the addition, making the house worth 500, with the same 400 of equity as before. (In some cases, spending 100 might add 150 to the house value, but let's assume here the increase is just what was spent.) When he dies, the mortgage has to be repaid. If he has no other money (that the two of you would otherwise split) then the mortgage has to be repaid by the two of you putting in cash. So you pay your brother 250 (half the new total value of the house) but he gives 50 of that to the bank for the mortgage. You also give 50 of your own money to the bank for the mortgage. Net result: your brother has 200 (the same as if he had inherited half the unimproved house), and you have a 500 house after paying out 300. Your gain is also the same as if the house was unimproved. Now if the house went up 150 by spending 100, or went up 60 by spending 100, you and your brother would also be sharing this profit or loss. If you don't want that to happen, you will need a different agreement. The advantage of the approach I'm suggesting is you just need one appraisal after your father dies.  Not accounted for in this is that you lived (without paying rent) in your father's house for some time, and that you worked (without being paid) as a caregiver to your father for that time. Some families might think those two things balanced, others might feel you need to be compensated for caring for him, and others that you need to compensate the others for your benefit of living in the large house. Be sure to discuss this with your brother so that you agree in advance whether a plan is fair or not.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Should your father retain the capacity to manage his finances and authorize contracts, I recommend a more favorable alternative. Ask your father to leverage his equity to finance the renovations. For instance, if his house is valued at 400 now, he can secure a loan of 100 against it. This amount will be spent on the extension, thereby enhancing the value of the house to 500 while maintaining the same equity of 400. (In certain circumstances, an expenditure of 100 would potentially add 150 to the property value, however, let's for now presume the value increment equals the expenditure.) Upon his death, the mortgage must be settled. If his remaining assets are insufficient (which you two would otherwise evenly split), both of you will need to contribute to settle the debt. As a result, you will pay your brother 250 (half the new total worth of the house), but he will return 50 of it to the bank to cover the mortgage. Additionally, You will also relinquish 50 of your money to the bank for the mortgage. Thus, your brother is left with 200 (as if inheriting half the unmodified home), and you end up with a home valued at 500 after parting with 300. Your profit is consistent with the state of the house remaining unmodified. Conversely, if the property value increased by 150 or 60 after spending 100, the profits or losses would be evenly distributed between you and your brother. If you find this disagreeable, you may need to consider an alternative agreement. The suggested approach's benefit is that a single assessment will be required after your father's passing. However, one must also consider the fact that you have been residing in your father's home without paying rent and providing unpaid caregiving services for your father during that period. Different families might perceive these two situations as neutral offsets, while some might believe you should be compensated for tending to him, and others might argue that you should offset the benefits you received from living in the big house. Make sure to negotiate this with your brother beforehand to reach a consensus on whether the plan is equitable or not.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I seem not to be able to comment on the first answer due to reputation, so I'll aim to enhanced the first answer which is generally good but with these caveats: 1) Dividends are not \"guaranteed\" to preferred shareholders.  Rather, preferred shareholders are normally in line ahead (i.e. in preference to or \"preferred\") of common shareholders in terms of dividend payment.  This is an extremely important distinction, because unlike investments that we generally consider \"guaranteed\" such as CDs (known as GICs in Canada), a company's board can suspend the dividend at anytime for long periods of time without significant repercussions -- whereas a missed payment to a bank or secured bondholder can often push a company into bankruptcy very quickly. 2) Due to point 1), it is extremely important to know the \"convenants\" or rules sorrounding both the preferred shares you are buying and the other more senior creditors of that issuing company (i.e. taxes (almost always come first), banks loans, leases, bonds etc.).  It is also important to know if a particular preferred share has \"cumulative\" dividends.  You generally only want to buy preferred's that have \"cumulative\" dividends, since that means that anytime the company misses a payment, they must pay those dividends first before any other dividends at the same or lower priority in the future. 3) Unlike a common stock, your upside on a preferred stock is relatively fixed: you get a fixed share of the company's profit and that's it, whereas a common shareholder gets everything that's left over after interest and preferred dividends are paid. So if the company does really well you will theoretically do much better with common stock over time. For the above reasons, it is generally advisable to think of preferred shares as being more similar to really risky bonds in the same company, rather than similar to common stock.   Of course, if you are an advanced investor there are a lot more variables in play such as tax considerations and whether the preferred have special options attached to them such conversion into common shares.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Due to my limitations with reputation, I'm unable to comment directly on the initial response. However, I seek to augment the first response, which is generally satisfactory, but with a few exceptions: 1) Dividends aren't “assured” to preferred shareholders. Rather, preferred shareholders usually have a higher priority (or are “preferred”) over ordinary shareholders when it involves dividend distribution. It's a crucial distinction that preferred shareholders’ dividends aren't guaranteed investments like CDs, commonly referred to as GICs in Canada. The board of a company can pause the dividend at any moment for extended windows, without major consequences – unlike a payment missed to a bank or secured bondholder, which could often rapidly drive a company into bankruptcy. 2) As an extension to the first point, it's essential to understand the “covenants” or regulations enclosing both the preferred shares you're purchasing and the other superior creditors of the same issuing company (i.e., taxes (typically always first), bank loans, leases, bonds, etc.). It's also crucial to know whether a specific preferred share has \"accumulative\" dividends. You'd generally want to purchase preferred shares with \"cumulative\" dividends, as this means any missed dividend must be paid out first before any future dividends at equivalent or lower seniority levels. 3) The potential gain you can make with a preferred share is comparatively limited: you’re entitled to a fixed share of the company's profits and nothing else, while an ordinary shareholder receives everything remaining after interests and preferred dividends are paid. Therefore, if the company does exceptionally well, common stock theoretically yields better returns over time. For these reasons, preferred shares should be considered more akin to highly risky bonds within the same company, rather than ordinary stock. However, for experienced investors, a host of other factors come into play, like tax implications and whether the preferred shares carry specific options such as the ability to convert into ordinary shares.\n",

Compared to the European Central Bank investing directly into the economy the way the US central bank has been doing. (The Federal Reserve buying mortgage backed securities) On a country level, individual European countries have tried this before in recent times with no noticeable effect.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Essentially, the idea at play here is to coax banks into circulating money into the economy rather than hoarding it. Contrary to the American Central Bank's direct investment methods (like the Federal Reserve's acquisition of mortgage-backed securities), the European Central Bank operates differently.

      " Generally \"default\" means that the company cannot pay off their debts, and since debt holders get paid before equity holders, their equity would be effectively worthless. That said, companies can emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy (reorganization) and retain equity value, but it is rare. Most times, stocks are de-listed or frozen on stock exchanges, and company's reorganization plan will cancel all existing equity shares, instead focusing all of their attention on paying back as much debt as possible. If the company issues new equity after reorganizing, it might provide a way for holders of the original equity to exchange their shares for the new equity, but it is rare, and the value is usually significantly less that the value of the original equity.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Ordinarily, when a firm is incapable of settling its obligations, it renders the equity virtually valueless given that creditors are paid prior to stockholders. However, even though it's infrequent, companies sometimes manage to preserve equity value while undergoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy, characterized by restructuring. More often than not, companies see their stock being suspended or stripped off the stock market listings, and the restructuring blueprint completely nullifies all standing equity stocks to primarily target debt repayment. Post-restructuring, if the company decides to issue fresh equity, it may offer an avenue for the original equity shareholders to swap their stocks for the new ones. But again, this is not a common occurrence and even when it does occur, the newly formed equity tends to bear much lower worth compared to the original equity.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Diversification is a risk-mitigation strategy. When you invest in equities, you generally get a higher rate of return than a fixed income investment. But you have risks... a single company's market value can decline for all sorts of reasons, including factors outside of the control of management. Diversification lets you spread risk and concentrate on sectors that you feel offer the best value. Investing outside of your currency zone allows you to diversify more, but also introduces currency risks, which require a whole other level of understanding. Today, investing in emerging markets is very popular for US investors because these economies are booming and US monetary policy has been weakening the dollar for some time. A major bank failure in China or a flip to a strong dollar policy could literally implode those investments overnight. At the end of the day, invest in what you understand. Know the factors that can lower your investment value.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Spreading out your investments is a tactic for limiting potential loss. If you put your money into company stocks, usually you can expect a greater profit than bonds. Nonetheless, the value of a single company's stocks can nosedive due to various reasons, some beyond the control of the company itself. By diversifying, you can scatter your risk and focus on areas that you believe hold the best worth. Taking your capital to foreign currency zones provides further diversification, though it also brings with it exchange rate risks needing a distinctive level of knowledge. American investors are currently showing significant interest in the up-and-coming markets due to their thriving nature and the dilution of the dollar caused by US monetary actions. However, events such as a significant bank collapse in China or a sudden shift in dollar strength could essentially obliterate those investments in an instant. Ultimately, it's safest to invest in ventures you are knowledgeable about, aware of what might devalue your investment.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Another good reason: if you have to replace a card due to damage, loss, or identity theft it's nice to have a backup you can use until the new card for your primary account arrives. I know folks who use a secondary card for online purchases specifically so they can kill it if necessary without impacting their other uses, online arguably being at more risk. If there's no yearly fee, and if you're already paying the bill in full every month, a second card/account is mostly harmless. If you have trouble restraining yourself with one card, a second could be dangerous.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  One logic for this could be: in instances where a card needs to be substituted due to wear, misplacement, or illicit activities, possessing an alternative card on hand might ease the inconvenience until you receive a replacement card for your main account. Several people opt for using their secondary card specifically for online transactions to enable immediate deactivation when required, without affecting their routine activities, as the electronic sphere is deemed more susceptible. In the absence of an annual charge, and providing the monthly bills are consistently cleared in full, an additional card or account doesn't pose much of an issue.

If you take the 0% loan you can't get the rebate. The price you negotiate minus the rebate is enough to make a profit. The key is not letting them know which offer you are interested in. Don't even mention a trade in until the price of the new car has been finalized. Otherwise they will adjust the price, rebate, interest rate, length of loan,  and trade-in value to maximize their profit. The suggestion of running the numbers through a spreadsheet is a good one. If you get a loan for 2% from your bank/credit union for 3 years and the rebate from the dealer, it will cost less in total than the 0% loan from the dealer. The key is to get the loan approved by the bank/credit union before meeting with the dealer. The money from the bank looks like cash to the dealer.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Auto dealerships possess a three-pronged strategy to make a profit. One way is through a full settlement payment; if the customer's payment surpasses the dealership's purchase cost for the car plus operating expenses, this results in profit. Another route is through financing the car; you pay monthly or yearly installments which, if exceeding the dealership's initial costs, expenses and financial charges, generates revenue. It might take years for the revenue to accumulate, or alternatively, they may opt to sell the loan to another firm to receive funds swiftly yet less. Trade-ins also contribute to the income; your old car is resold for a profitable price; this could entail a full payment or financing for the resale. There's an additional option where they make a profit through maintenance and expensive dealer options. Some dealers offer two package options for you to select: a 0% interest loan or a cash payment with a rebate. However, neither can be clubbed together. The cost deduction from the rebate is profitable enough. Keep quiet about your choice and any trade-ins until the new car's price is fixed, or they may tweak the price, rebate, interest, loan duration, and trade-in estimate to maximize their profit. It's a good idea to calculate these expenses. For instance, a 2% bank loan for three years along with the dealer's rebate could potentially cost less than the dealer's 0% interest loan. Proper advance planning with the bank before meeting the dealer is essential, as the bank loan appears as cash to the dealer.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The Fair Credit Reporting Act specifies in some detail on pages 50-54 (as labeled in the footer, 55-59 as pages in pdf) the process that occurs when a consumer initiates a dispute.  The safe outcome for the reporting agency is to remove the information in dispute  from reports within 30 days if the reporting party does not certify the information is complete and accurate (with other statutory timelines for communication to the customer and the reporter).   If you initiate a dispute, then the agency is following the law by deleting the reported information, outside new input from the furnisher.  If this is unsatisfactory, you have the following statutory right within § 611. Procedure in case of disputed accuracy [15 U.S.C. § 1681i (d) Notification of deletion of disputed information. Following any deletion of   information which is found to be inaccurate or whose accuracy can no longer   be verified or any notation as to disputed information, the consumer   reporting agency shall, at the request of the consumer, furnish notification   that the item has been deleted or the statement, codification or summary   pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section to any person specifically   designated by the consumer who has within two years prior thereto received   a consumer report for employment purposes, or within six months   prior thereto received a consumer report for any other purpose, which   contained the deleted or disputed information.  The section that binds furnishers of information (§ 623. Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies [15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2], starting on page 78 in the footer) places on them the following specific duties: (B) Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors.   A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to   any consumer reporting agency if   (i) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address   specified by the person for such notices, that specific   information is inaccurate; and   (ii) the information is, in fact, inaccurate. ... (2) Duty to correct and update information. A person who   (A) regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information   to one or more consumer reporting agencies about the   person’s transactions or experiences with any consumer; and   (B) has furnished to a consumer reporting agency information   that the person determines is not complete or accurate, shall   promptly notify the consumer reporting agency of that determination   and provide to the agency any corrections to that information,   or any additional information, that is necessary to make   the information provided by the person to the agency complete   and accurate, and shall not thereafter furnish to the agency any   of the information that remains not complete or accurate. So there you have it: they have to stop reporting inaccurate information, and \"promptly\" notify the credit agency once they've determined what is incomplete or inaccurate. I note no specific statutory timeline for this investigation.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The rules outlined between pages 50-54 in the Fair Credit Reporting Act sheds light on the protocols to abide by when a customer raises a disagreement. Should the party reporting fail to verify and confirm the information being accurate and all-encompassing within a timespan of 30 days, the safest bet for the reporting organization is to eliminate the disputed details from the report. Other timelines are also fixed by law for communicating updates to the customer and the reporter. Whenever you instigate a dispute, the agency would duly adhere to the legal mandate of erasing the reported data, excepting new feedback from the provider. If this is not satisfactory, you are entitled to rights stipulated under § 611. Post the deletion of inaccurate details, the agency must notify any person, specifically indicated by the customer who has previously received a report for employment or other purposes. The segment concerning providers of data (§ 623) assigns them specific responsibilities to avoid reporting incorrect details and update the agency on changes in due course. There's no clear mandate on the time duration allowed for this investigation.\n",

For a great number of people to find new work. I don't know the numbers, but anyone involved with personal income taxes would be out of work. Sales tax is already part of the process in most states, bumping it to a federal tax wont add too much in overhead.  I make no moral judgment, but consider, most prostitutes and drug dealers are avoiding income tax, but they still are buying the same goods in stores you and I are. This proposed tax reduces the collection noncompliance, and brings more people into \"the system\".  Another factor some may not like is the ability to affect behavior by picking and choosing what to promote, via deductions, such as home buying or charity.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The main hurdle lies in the shift itself. It's about acclimatizing individuals to the point-of-sale tax instead of the paycheck tax. Numerous individuals would have to seek alternate employment. I'm unsure of the specifics, but those dealing with personal income tax may find themselves without jobs. Most states already implement a sales tax, so escalating it to a national level shouldn't significantly increase the administrative burden. Understandably, there's no judgement here, but take into account that many illegal workers such as sex workers and drug peddlers dodge paying income tax, but they too make similar purchases as everyone else in the marketplace. The proposed tax lowers the potential for tax evasion and incorporates more individuals within the tax net. Another point of contention could be the power to influence behaviour by selectively encouraging certain actions by offering tax breaks, like property purchases or donations. However, this information about influencing behaviour is a new addition, not present in the original context.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Consider the futures market. Traders buy and sell gold futures, but very few contracts, relatively speaking, result in delivery. The contracts are sold, and \"Open interest\" dwindles to near zero most months as the final date approaches. The seller buys back his short position, the buyer sells off his longs.  When I own a call, and am 'winning,' say the option that cost me $1 is now worth $2, I'd rather sell that option for even $1.95 than to buy 100 shares of a $148 stock. The punchline is that very few option buyers actually hope to own the stock in the end. Just like the futures, open interest falls as expiration approaches.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Taking the stock futures market into account, transactions involving gold futures are commonplace among traders. Despite this, only a minute fraction of contracts go as far as delivery, with most fizzling out as their termination date nears. Most sellers repurchase their short positioning, while buyers typically liquidate their longs. Suppose I possess an appreciating call option, for example, one that initially cost me $1 but is currently valued at $2. My preference would be to dispose of this option for even a slight loss of, say, $1.95 rather than acquiring a hundred shares of a stock worth $148. The twist here is that the motive of a majority of option purchasers is not necessarily ownership of the stock eventually. The tale ends the same way as futures, inclusive of a decline in open interest as the expiration deadline looms.\n",

Their status allows them to represent clients before the IRS (which a CPA can also do) See the IRS site regarding Enrolled Agents Their focus is much narrower than a CPA and you would only hire them for advice or representation with tax related matters.  (e.g. you'd not hire an enrolled agent to do an external audit)  A CPA is a much broader certification, covering accounting in general, of which taxes are only a portion. A CPA may or may not specialize in tax matters, so if you have a tax related issue, especially an audit, review or appeal, you may want to query a prospective CPA as to their experience with tax matters and representing clients, appeals, etc. You would likely be better off with an EA than a CPA who eschews tax work and specializes in other things such as financial auditsOn the other hand if you have need of advice that is more generalized to accounting, audits, etc then you'd want to talk with a CPA as opposed to an EA\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Certified Enrolled Agents are often generalists in the field of accounting. Despite being able to represent customers in front of the IRS, akin to a CPA, their scope of work often transcends the boundaries of tax-related issues. Nonetheless, they can be hired for guidance or representation surrounding tax questions and audits. An accountant with a CPA qualification has a more limited scope focused only on tax, even though it can encompass broader areas in accounting. A CPA's specialization in taxes or other areas, such as financial audits, is entirely optional. However, should you require assistance regarding a tax audit, appeal or review, it's advisable to confirm a CPA's expertise in tax matters. The better choice might be an Enrolled Agent for tax-related concerns, unlike a CPA who doesn't deal with tax work.

Keep in mind there are 2 prices: bid and offer. If the current bid and current offer were the same, it would immediately result in a trade, and thus the bid and offer are no longer the same. Market Makers are paid / given lower fees in order to maintain buy and sell prices (called quotes) at most times. These conditions are usually all true, but commonly fail for these reasons: Most markets have an order type of market order that says buy/sell at any price. There are still sanity checks put in place on the price, with the exact rules for valid prices depending on the stock, so unless it's a penny stock you won't suddenly pay ten times a stock's value. *The amount you can buy sell is limited by the quantity that exists on the bid and offer. If there is a bid or offer, the quantity is always at least 1.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Opportunities to purchase or vend commodities is possible provided the marketplace is functioning and not in auction state, there are existing proposals or desires on the commodity you are looking to exchange, and your order is known by the market.

Market regulators are compensated with reduced dues for maintaining purchasing and selling rates (termed as quotes) most of the time. These scenarios often hold truth, but occasionally fall flat due to some obstacles: Most marketplaces have an order that states that trading can happen at any rate. There are 'sanity checks' for the price, the criteria for which vary with each stock, barring exceptionally cheap stocks that won't make you pay tenfold.

      "Reference Response:  The game is not zero sum. When a friend and I chop down a tree, and build a house from it, the house has value, far greater than the value of a standing tree. Our labor has turned into something of value.  In theory, a company starts from an idea, and offers either a good or service to create value. There are scams that make it seem like a Vegas casino. There are times a stock will trade for well above what it should. When I buy the S&P index at a fair price for 1000 (through an etf or fund) and years later it's 1400, the gain isn't out of someone else's pocket, else the amount of wealth in the world would be fixed and that's not the case. Over time, investors lag the market return for multiple reasons, trading costs, bad timing, etc. Statements such as \"90% lose money\" are hyperbole meant to separate you from your money. A self fulfilling prophesy.   The question of lagging the market is another story - I have no data to support my observation, but I'd imagine that well over 90% lag the broad market. A detailed explanation is too long for this forum, but simply put, there are trading costs. If I invest in an S&P ETF that costs .1% per year, I'll see a return of say 9.9% over decades if the market return is 10%. Over 40 years, this is 4364% compounded, vs the index 4526% compounded, a difference of less than 4% in final wealth. There are load funds that charge more than this just to buy in (5% anyone?).  Lagging by a small fraction is a far cry from 'losing money.'  There is an annual report by a company named Dalbar that tracks investor performance. For the 20 year period ending 12/31/10 the S&P returned 9.14% and Dalbar calculates the average investor had an average return of 3.83%. Pretty bad, but not zero. Since you don't cite a particular article or source, there may be more to the story. Day traders are likely to lose. As are a series of other types of traders in other markets, Forex for one.  While your question may be interesting, its premise of \"many experts say....\" without naming even one leaves room for doubt.  Note - I've updated the link for the 2015 report. And 4 years later, I see that when searching on that 90% statistic, the articles are about day traders. That actually makes sense to me.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The concept of zero sum doesn't apply to every game. When my associate and I fell a tree and construct a dwelling from its timber, this home possesses worth far exceeding that of the untouched tree. Our exertion has been transformed into something valuable. In principle, a firm can originate a product or service from a mere idea to produce value. Certain deceitful practices can make it appear like a gamble in a Vegas establishment. Stocks can occasionally sell for more than their worth. Suppose I acquire the S&P index fairly priced at 1000 (via an etf or fund) and it balloons to 1400 years later. The additional gain did not come at the expense of another individual otherwise the world's wealth would be constant, which is not true. For several reasons like trading expenditures, poor timing, investors tend to trail the market return over time.Statements such as \"90% lose money\" serve as exaggerated caution designed to separate you from your wealth, becoming a self fulfilling prophecy. The issue of trailing the market is a separate matter - although I lack supporting evidence, I speculate that over 90% lag the general market. A comprehensive elucidation is too lengthy but in brief, there are trading expenses. Investing in an S&P ETF with .1% annual cost will offer a return of roughly 9.9% over long periods if the market return is 10%. This will accumulate to 4364% over 40 years, compared to the 4526% of the index, leading to a less than 4% gap in ultimate wealth. There are loaded funds with more than this as a buy-in cost (5% anyone?). Being slightly behind is very different from 'losing money.' Dalbar, a firm, provides an annual survey of investor performance. As per their results, the S&P gave a 9.14% return and average investors received a disappointing 3.83% for the 20-year period ending 31st Dec 2010. Bad, but not a total loss. Without a specific citation, there could be more elements involved. Day and Forex traders are likely to lose. Your question's assumption of \"many experts say....\" without providing any names leaves room for skepticism. Lastly, I've updated the 2015 report link, and it's clear after 4 years of research that the 90% lose money statistic is mostly associated with day traders, which seems plausible to me. In the paraphrase, you can see extra information was added, this includes the comparison between untouched tree and home and the talk of loaded funds with buy-in costs.\n",

      "Reference Response:  One of the best answers to this question that I've ever read is in a paper published by Robert Lucas in the Journal of Economic Perspectives. That journal is meant to a be a place for experts to write about their area of expertise (in economics) for a general but still technically-minded audience. They recently opened up the journal as free to the public, which is a fantastic resource -- you no longer need a subscription to JSTOR (or whatever) to read it.  You can read the abstract to the paper, and find a link to it, here. One of the things that I like a lot about this paper is that it strips out absolutely everything even slightly unnecessary to thinking about a macroeconomy, and just discusses what one can arrive at with a very very simple model. Of course, with great simplicity come sacrifice about details. However, it does a great job of answering your question, \"why do people care about growth?\" A quick note: the key to understanding the answer to your question is to think about things in terms of \"the long term\"  -- not even looking forward to the future, because we'll be dead by then, but looking back to the past. The key to the importance of growth is that, for the last ~200 years, the US has, on average, had maybe 2-3% \"real growth\" per year (I'm pulling these numbers out of my head; I think much better numbers are in that paper somewhere). On average, over that period of time, this growth has meant that the quality of life that one has, if one lives in a country experiencing this growth, is enormous compared to countries that do not experience this average growth over that period.  Statistically speaking, growth is also somewhat auto-correlated. Roughly speaking, if it was low the last few periods, you can expect it to be low the next period. Same thing if it's high.   Then, the reason we care about growth right now: if you have too many periods of low growth, pretty soon the average \"over the long term\" growth will be pulled down -- and then quality of life can't be higher in the future (which quickly becomes someone's \"present\"). The paper above makes this point with a very simple model. Of course, none of this touches on distributional issues, which are another issue entirely. With respect to, \"The economy needs to grow to just keep up with its debt repayments,\" I think the answer is along the lines of, \"sometimes countries get into debt expecting that growth will increase their resources in the future, and thus they can pay back their debt.\" That strategy is, of course, the strategy that anyone borrowing (\"taking out a loan\") should be employing -- you should expect that your future income will be enough to pay back your interest+principle on a loan you took. Otherwise you're irresponsible. At the aggregate level, production is the nation's \"income\" -- it is what you have, all that you have (as a nation) to pay back any debt you've incurred at the national level.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  A brilliant explanation to this query can be found in an article by Robert Lucas featured in the Economic Perspectives Journal. It's a publication that allows professionals to express their knowledge in economics ideal for both general and technically-inclined audience. The Journal has been made open to everybody free of charge, making it a wonderful resource--you don't have to rely on a JSTOR subscription (or similar platforms) anymore to access it. Here's a link to the paper's abstract which will guide you to the full article. What I find appealing about this paper is the way it strips everything nonessential when understanding a macroeconomy, dwelling solely on simplistic models. Despite missing out on some details due to its simplicity, it brilliantly answers the question, \"what's the hype around growth?\" Quick tip: comprehending this answer requires you to think long-term and retrospective, not futuristic as we won't be around then. Providing some context, the US has, for the past two centuries or so, seen approximately 2-3% \"real growth annually (I am estimating this, better figures are likely in the paper). Factoring in this period, such development implies that people living in such a growing country enjoy a much higher quality of life than those in non-growing countries. Growth over time tends to be somewhat self-reliant; if it's been low, expect it to remain the same and vice versa. The concern over growth at present because periods of stunted growth could mean a reduced long-term average growth, compromising future (soon to be current) quality of life. The aforementioned paper explains this effectively using a simple model. But this doesn't delve into distributional matters, which is another can of worms. Regarding the need for economic growth to offset debt repayments, the answer might be that countries assume increased future growth, hence more resources, enabling them to service their debt. This should be the thinking behind any borrower's motive to take a loan, foreseeing enough future income to repay their loan's interest and principal. Anything less is reckless. On a nationwide scale, production equates to a country's \"income\" and is key in settling any national debt incurred.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Automatic exercisions can be extremely risky, and the closer to the money the options are, the riskier their exercisions are. It is unlikely that the entire account has negative equity since a responsible broker would forcibly close all positions and pursue the holder for the balance of the debt to reduce solvency risk.  Since the broker has automatically exercised a near the money option, it's solvency policy is already risky. Regardless of whether there is negative equity or simply a liability, the least risky course of action is to sell enough of the underlying to satisfy the loan by closing all other positions if necessary as soon as possible. If there is a negative equity after trying to satisfy the loan, the account will need to be funded for the balance of the loan to pay for purchases of the underlying to fully satisfy the loan. Since the underlying can move in such a way to cause this loan to increase, the account should also be funded as soon as possible if necessary. Accounts after exercise For deep in the money exercised options, a call turns into a long underlying on margin while a put turns into a short underlying. The next decision should be based upon risk and position selection.  First, if the position is no longer attractive, it should be closed.  Since it's deep in the money, simply closing out the exposure to the underlying should extinguish the liability as cash is not marginable, so the cash received from the closing out of the position will repay any margin debt. If the position in the underlying is still attractive then the liability should be managed according to one's liability policy and of course to margin limits. In a margin account, closing the underlying positions on the same day as the exercise will only be considered a day trade.  If the positions are closed on any business day after the exercision, there will be no penalty or restriction. Cash option accounts While this is possible, many brokers force an upgrade to a margin account, and the ShareBuilder Options Account Agreement seems ambiguous, but their options trading page implies the upgrade. In a cash account, equities are not marginable, so any margin will trigger a margin call.  If the margin debt did not trigger a margin call then it is unlikely that it is a cash account as margin for any security in a cash account except for certain options trades is 100%. Equities are convertible to cash presumably at the bid, so during a call exercise, the exercisor or exercisor's broker pays cash for the underlying at the exercise price, and any deficit is financed with debt, thus underlying can be sold to satisfy that debt or be sold for cash as one normally would. To preempt a forced exercise as a call holder, one could short the underlying, but this will be more expensive, and since probably no broker allows shorting against the box because of its intended use to circumvent capital gains taxes by fraud.  The least expensive way to trade out of options positions is to close them themselves rather than take delivery.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Automated exercises of options can pose serious risks. The higher the proximity of the options to the money, the more potentially hazardous their exercises turn out to be. It's implausible for an account to be completely in negative equity as a conscientious broker would proactively close all positions to chase the holder for the remaining debt in order to lessen insolvency risk. In the event that the broker has auto-exercised an option near the money, their solvency policy is already at risk. Irrespective of having a negative equity or just a liability, the safest strategy is to sell an ample amount of the underlying to settle the debt by closing all other positions as promptly as possible. If negative equity persists after trying to repay the loan, the account will need additional funds to cover the loan balance to pay for buying the underlying to satisfy the loan fully. As the underlying might shift and increase this loan, the account should also be supplied with extra funds as soon as possible if required. After executing deep in the money options, a call turns into a long underlying on margin while a put turns into a short underlying. What follows should be decided considering risk and position selection. If the position is no longer appealing, it should be removed. Being deep in the money, merely terminating the exposure to the underlying will cancel out the liability as cash has no marginability, so the cash acquired from terminating the position will reimburse any margin debt. If the underlying position is still desirable, then the liability should be managed according to an individual's liability policy and, of course, to margin limits. In a margin account, terminating the underlying positions on the same day as exercise will be viewed as a day trade. There won't be any penalty or restriction if the positions are closed on any business day post-exercise. In relation to cash option accounts, many brokers enforce an upgrade to a margin account. The ShareBuilder Options Account Agreement may seem unclear, but their options trading page suggests the upgrade. In a cash account, equities are not marginable which means any margin will prompt a margin call. If the margin debt did not bring a margin call, then it's doubtful that it's a cash account because the margin for any security in a cash account, except for certain options trades, is 100%. Equities can be converted to cash, so during a call exercise, the entity exercising the option or their broker pays cash for the underlying at the exercise price, with any shortage financed with debt. The underlying can, therefore, be sold to satisfy that debt or for cash as usual. In order to big step a forced exercise as a call holder, one could short the underlying, but this would come at a greater cost. Given that most brokers probably don't permit shorting against the box due to it being intended to bypass capital gains taxes fraudulently, the most cost-effective way to trade out of option positions is to close them rather than accepting delivery.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Short selling can be a good strategy to hedge, but you have almost unlimited downside.  If a stock price skyrockets, you may be forced to cover your short by the brokerage before you want to or put up more capital. A smarter strategy to hedge, that limits your potential downside is to buy puts if you think the market is going down.  Your downside is limited to the total amount that you purchased the put for and no more. Another way to hedge is to SELL calls that are covered because you own the shares the calls refer to.  You might do this if you thought your stock was going to go down but you didn't want to sell your shares right now.  That way the only downside if the price goes up is you give up your shares at a predetermined price and you miss out on the upside, but your downside is now diminished by the premium you were paid for the option. (You'd still lose money if the shares went down since you still own them, but you got paid the option premium so that helps offset that).\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Using short selling may serve as an effective way to safeguard investments, however, the potential losses are essentially boundless. In situations where the value of stock soars, brokers could potentially force you to offset your shorts sooner than you intended or require more funding from you. An alternative, more prudent hedging strategy would be to purchase puts if you predict a declining market. The extent of your loss is then limited only to the amount you invested in buying the put. Another hedging strategy involves selling covered calls that you own. This strategy may appeal if you foresee your stock value dropping but are not ready to sell your shares just yet. The only risk in case of a price hike is having to give up shares at a set price thus missing any advantage from the elevation. Although, the disadvantage has now shrunk owing to the premium earned from the sold option. In case the share prices reduce, there will be losses, but these are countered by the procured option premium.\n",

What expectancy do you need to achieve? Which markets you will choose to trade?  Your first step should be to develop a Trading Plan, then develop your trading rules and your risk management. Then you should back test your strategy and then use a virtual account to practice losing on. Because one thing you will get is many losses. You have to learn to take a loss when the market moves against you. And you need to let your profits run and keep your losses small. A good book to start with is Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom by Van Tharp. It will teach you about Expectancy, Money Management, Risk Management and the Phycology of Trading. Two thing I can recommend are: 1) to look into position and trend trading and other types of short term trading instead of day trading. You would usually place your trades after market close together with your stops and avoid being in front of the screen all day trying to chase the market. You need to take your emotion out of your trading if you want to succeed; 2) don't trade penny stocks, trade commodities, FX or standard stocks, but keep away from penny stocks. Just because you can buy them for a penny does not mean they are cheap.\n",

Initiating a Trading Scheme should be your primary move, then formulate your trading stipulations and risk mitigation measures. Afterward, strategize a back test and utilize a virtual account to practice handling failures. For being a trader, occasional losses are inevitable. You need to be adept in handling a setback when the market trends aren't favoring you. Equally important is to allow your gains to increase while curbing any potential losses. A great initial read could be Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom by Van Tharp, which enlightens about Expectancy, Money Management, Risk Management, and Trading Psychology.

Your trades would usually be placed post market close as you also incorporate your stops, eliminating the need of being glued to the screen the entire day, trying to catch up with the market. It's crucial to keep emotional decisions at bay when trading to ensure success. I'd also recommend against trading penny stocks, and suggest trading standard stocks, commodities, FX, but absolutely avoid penny stocks.

What I gleen from your summary is a 1% match to the 10% invested, but a .8% expense. The ETF VOO has a .05% annual fee, a bit better than SPY.  A quick few calculations show that the 10% bonus does offset a long run of the .75% excess expense compared to external investing. After decades, the 401(k) appears to still be a bit ahead. Not the dramatic delta suggested in the prior answer, but enough to stay with the 401(k) in this situation. The tiny match still makes the difference. Edit - the question you linked to. The 401(k) had no match, and an awful 1.2% annual expense. This combination is deadly for the younger investor. Always an exception to offer - a 25% marginal rate earner close to retiring at 15%. The 401(k) deposit saves him 25, but can soon be withdrawn at 15, it's worth a a few years of that fee to make this happen.

      "Paraphrased Response:  It seems like you comprehended most of my points broadly. Regrettably, Patches' math flew over my head. From your paraphrase, it seems we're dealing with a 1% match for 10% input and an expense of .8%. The ETF VOO comes with an annual fee of .05%, slightly superior to SPY. After hastily running some numbers, I notice that the 10% bonus manages to counteract the recurring .75% excess expense when juxtaposed with external investment. Over a long timeline, the 401(k) just manages to edge out. It might not be the vast difference previously mooted, but it's enough to stick with the 401(k) under these circumstances. The fractional match is still the game changer here. Update - referring to the associated query. In that instance, the 401(k) lacked any match and had an outrageous 1.2% yearly overhead. This combo could cripple a newbie investor. To mention an outlier - a worker in the 25% tax bracket soon to retire at 15%. The 401(k) deposit saves them 25, and given that it can be withdrawn at 15, it is worth enduring a couple years of that fee to see this through.

      "Reference Response:  It's a trade-off. The answer depends on your risk tolerance. Seeking higher rewards demands higher risk. If you want advice, I would recommend hiring an expert to design a plan which meets your needs. As a sample point, NOT necessarily right for anyone else...I'm considered an aggressive investor, and my own spread is still more conservative than many folks. I'm entirely in low-cost index funds, distributed as ... with the money tied up in a \"quiesced\" defined-contribution pension fund being treated as a low-yield bond. Some of these have beaten the indexes they're tracking, some haven't. My average yield since I started investing has been a bit over 10%/year (not including the company match on part of the 401k), which I consider Good Enough -- certainly good enough for something that requires near-zero attention from me. Past results are not a guarantee of future performance. This may be completely wrong for someone at a different point in their career and/or life and/or finances. I'm posting it only as an example, NOT a recommendation.  Regarding when to rebalance: Set some threshhold at which things have drifted too far from your preferred distribution (value of a fund being 5% off its target percentage in the mix is one rule I've sometimes used), and/or pick some reasonable (usually fairly low) frequency at which you'll actively rebalance (once a year, 4x/year, whenever you change your car's oil, something like that), and/or rebalance by selecting which funds you deposit additional money into whenever you're adding to the investments. Note that that last option avoids having to take capital gains, which is generally a good thing; you want as much of your profit to be long-term as possible, and to avoid triggering the \"wash sales\" rule. Generally, you do not have to rebalance very frequently unless you are doing something that I'd consider unreasonably risky, or unless you're managing such huge sums that a tiny fraction of a percent still adds up to real money.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In terms of investment strategy, it's all about balancing risks and rewards. Your personal threshold for risk dictates your potential for gain. For personalized guidance, consider acquiring the services of a professional to craft a customized plan suitable for you. Speaking from my own not universally applicable experiences, my investment strategy, while aggressive, is temperate compared to some. I've put all my money into economical index funds with a structure akin to... Some of these funds have trumped their benchmarks, while some have missed the mark. From the moment I began investing, I've had an average annual yield slightly beyond 10% (excluding the employer match for a part of my 401k), which I deem satisfactory. Remember, previous success is no guarantee of future outcomes. This strategy may not work for those in different financial or life circumstances. I share my strategy purely as an illustration and not as a prescription. As for portfolio rebalancing: establish a specific point beyond which your portfolio deviates too much from your ideal distribution (for instance, I sometimes adopt a rule where a fund's value is 5% off its intended percentage in the allotment), or opt for a reasonable frequency (a year, quarterly, during car maintenance, etc.) to actively adjust your portfolio. Alternatively, you could rebalance by determining where to direct new investments. This method avoids the need for realizing capital gains and can potentially maintain more of your profits for the long haul, preventing the triggering of \"wash sales\" rule. Unless you are taking on inadvisable risks or handling such enormous sums that even a slight fraction of a percentage translates into substantial sums, frequent rebalancing generally isn't a necessity.\n",

They just about invented index funds, usually have the lowest (internal) expenses for index and many other funds, if you take electronic instead of paper statements there is no maintenance fee, have no transaction commission, can do periodic automatic investment from a bank account etc.  A typical index fund there would require an initial $3000 investment and would have a minimum of $100 for each additional investment.  If you can't come up with an initial sum of that size, you might be able to find a broker with a lower minimum and suitable free ETFs trades as others have suggested.\n",

They don't charge for transactions and enable consistent automatic investments from your bank account. The usual investment hurdle at Vanguard is an initial amount of $3000 and ongoing investments of a bare minimum of $100.

      "Reference Response:  Like all other loan-vs-savings questions, it depends on the terms of the loan. If you have a choice, the usual answer is to pay off the loan with the worst terms (which usually means the highest interest rate) first, and only start with savings when you've paid off all the high-interest loans entirely. If your student loan is on US terms, then pay it off as soon as you can, unless you have commercial debt (credit-card or unsecured personal loan), which you should pay off first, or unless you have or are realistically likely to get eligibility for a forgiveness program. But it does depends on the terms of the debt, which in turn depend on the country you studied in; on UK terms it's a very bad idea to pay off a student loan any faster than you have to.  Interest is restricted to the rate of inflation, so good investments probably beat the interest rate of the student loan; the required repayments vary with your income, so savings are more useful than debt repayment if you encounter income difficulties (e.g unemployment) in the future, and finally the debt is automatically forgiven after 30 years, so you may never have to pay it all back anyway - so why pay it off voluntarily if it would get forgiven eventually anyway?\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Just like other savings-vs-loan dilemmas, it's all about the conditions of the loan. If there are options, typically the advice is to eliminate the loan with the most detrimental conditions—which often signifies the topmost interest rate—first, and begin saving only once you're entirely free of high-interest loans. Should your educational loan be based on U.S. terms, aim to clear it as fast as possible, unless you carry commercial liabilities such as credit card debt or an informal personal loan, which ought to be settled first, or in case you possess or have a fair chance to qualify for a debt forgiveness scheme. However, the conditions of your debt differ based on the nation you pursued your education in; under UK rules, it's absolutely unfavorable to repay a student loan quicker than necessary. The interest is confined to inflation rate, thus efficient investments might outweigh the interest of the educational loan; the mandatory payouts adapt according to your earnings, hence savings might assist more than debt repayments in case of economic hardships such as joblessness, and last but not least, the debt received automatic clemency after three decades, so there's a chance you might not ever need to repay the full amount - so what's the point in voluntarily paying it off if it would be waived off after some time?\n",

      "Reference Response:  There are some economic signs as there are in all economic and business cycles, such as interest rates rising. However, a more effective way is to actually look at price action itself. The definition of an uptrend is higher highs followed by higher lows. The definition of a downtrend is lower lows followed by lower highs. So if you are looking to invest for the long term you can look at the weekly or even the monthly chart of the market say over the past 10, 15 or 20 years. Using these definitions on say the S&P500 if the price continues to make higher highs and higher lows then stay in the market. If the price makes a lower high than the previous high, then this is a warning sign that the trend may be about to end. The trend has not broken yet but it is a warning sign that it could be ending soon. If the price makes a higher low next followed by a higher high, then the trend continues and you just need to keep an eye on things. If, however, the price makes a lower low after the lower high this is a signal that the uptrend is over and you should get out of the market. If the price makes a lower low directly after a higher high, then be cautious and wait for confirmation that the uptrend is over. If you then get a lower high this is confirmation that the uptrend is over, you would then sell if prices drop below the previous low. If you invest in individual shares then you should keep an eye on the charts for the index and individual shares as well. The index chart will give you an indication if the uptrend is over for the whole market, then you can be more cautious in regards to the individual shares. You can then plan exit points on each individual share if their trends are broken too. If you have stop losses employed and the trend reverses on the index, this would be a good time to tighten your stop losses on individual shares. You can then buy back into the market when you determine that the downtrend is broken and prices start to show higher highs and higher lows again. Will there be occasions when the uptrend reverses and then after a short period starts trending up again, yes there might be, but the worse that will happen is that you pay a bit of extra brokerage to get out and then back into the market, and you might have to pay some capital gains tax on any profits made. But remember no one ever went broke making a profit. The most important thing to remember when investing is to conserve and protect your capital. I would rather pay some extra brokerage and some capital gains tax than see my portfolio drop by 50% or more, then take 5 years or more to recover. And remember, paying tax is a good thing, it means you made money. If you don't want to pay any tax it means you will never make any profits, because if you make profits you will have to pay tax one day.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  There are certain indicators within all economic and business cycles, for instance, skyrocketing interest rates. Yet, a superior approach would be to directly observe the price activity. High peaks followed by lofty lows characterize an uptrend, while low troughs succeeded by lower peaks represent a downtrend. When planning to invest long-term, examining a weekly or even monthly market timeline for the past 10 to 20 years can be beneficial. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, consider the S&P500; if it maintains a pattern of ascending highs and ascending lows, remain in the market. If it exhibits a lower peak compared to the previous one, consider this an warning that the trend might be concluding soon. If the trend continues with a high low followed by a high peak, simply keep monitoring the situation. Exceptions for caution include when the price after a lower peak shows a lower low, indicating an ending uptrend and suggesting you to withdraw from the market. Additionally, if a lower low appears immediately after a higher peak, wait for an affirmation that the uptrend concludes. At this point, if another lower peak is observed, you should possibly sell if the prices descend below the previous low.\n",
      "\n",
      "For investors with individual stocks, it's imperative to keep track of the index and individual stock charts. The index chart can alert you if the market's uptrend concludes, enabling you to cautiously react to individual shares. This also allows you to strategize the exit strategy for each individual stock, should their trends be interrupted. Having stop losses in place and a trend reversal on the index signals tightening your stop losses on individual shares. You could reenter the market when there is evidence of a broken downtrend and prices start showcasing higher peaks and higher troughs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instances might occur when the uptrend inverts briefly before resuming its upward trend. Avoidable extra brokerage costs and capital gains tax on profits might be incurred by moving in and out of the market during these periods. But never forget the importance of making profits, as no one has ever gone bankrupt by earning profits. The cardinal rule in investments is to safeguard and grow your capital. Incurring some additional brokerage and capital gains tax is better than witnessing a 50% or more dip in your portfolio, which may take five or more years to recuperate. Don't fear tax as it is a symbol of your profits. Shying away from taxes could mean missing out on profits, because where there are profits, there is tax.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Though it seems unintuitive, you should rationally ignore the past performance of this stock (including the fact that it's at its 52-week high) and focus exclusively on factors that you believe should affect it moving forward.  If you think it's going to go up even further,  more than the return on your other options for where to put the money, keep the stock.  If you think it's peaked and will be going down, now's a good time to sell. To put it another way: if you didn't already have this stock, would you buy it today? Your choice is just about the same: you can choose between a sum of cash equal to the present market value of the shares, OR the shares.   Which do you think is worth more? You also mentioned that you only have 10 stocks in the portfolio.  Some are probably a larger percentage than others, and this distribution may be different than what you want in your portfolio.  It may be time to do some rebalancing, which could involve selling some shares where your position is too large (as a % of your portfolio) and using the proceeds toward one or more categories you're not as invested in as you would like to be.  This might be a good opportunity to increase the diversity in your portfolio. If part of your reward and motivation for trading is emotional, not purely financial, you could sell now, mark it as a \"win,\" and move on to another opportunity.  Trading based on emotions is not likely to optimize your future balance, but not everybody is into trading or money for money's sake.  What's going to help you sleep better at night and help boost your quality of life?  If holding the stock will make you stress and regret a missed opportunity if it goes down, and selling it will make you feel happy and confident even if it still goes up more (e.g. you interpret that as further confirming that you made a good pick in the first place), you might decide that the risk of suboptimal financial returns (from emotion-based trading) is acceptable.  As CQM points out, you could also set a trailing sell order to activate only when the stock is a certain percentage or dollar amount below whatever it peaks at between the time you set the order and the time it fires/expires; the activation price will rise with the stock and hold as it falls.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Contrary to popular belief, it's wise to overlook the pre-existing performance of this stock - even its peak within the last 52 weeks - and concentrate only on future aspects that could potentially influence its behavior. If you predict higher gains compared to other potential investments, stick with it. If you see it's at its climax and likely to nosedive soon, it's advisable to dispense it. Look at it from this perspective: If this stock wasn't already in your possession, would it tempt you to purchase it today? Essentially, you can opt for cash equal to the stock's current market value or stay with the stock. Which seems more valuable to you? You noted that you own 10 distinct stocks. The allocation amongst these stocks might not be exactly as you wish, and some definitely make up larger portions of your portfolio. You might want to consider rebalancing, possibly by reducing holdings where the percentage contribution is higher than desired and allocating the gains to other under-invested sectors. This could add versatility to your portfolio. If emotions, not just finances, influence your trading decisions, it could be beneficial to sell now, celebrate a 'victory', and seek a new venture. Emotional trading seldom maximizes financial returns, but remember that not everyone is motivated solely by monetary gain. What would make you feel fulfilled? If remaining in possession of the stock induces stress and remorse about potentially lost opportunities, and letting it go brings happiness and trust even if ongoing increases occur (you might see this as validation of your wise initial choice), embracing the hazards of reduced financial yield due to emotion-driven trading could be an acceptable trade-off. As CQM suggests, setting a trailing sell order which would initiate only if the stock's value dips a certain percentage or cash amount below its peak after setting the order and before its activation or expiration might be worth considering - the triggering price would escalate with the stock and maintain as it declines.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The refund may offset your liability for the next year, especially if you are a Schedule \"C\" filer.  By having your refund applied to the coming year's taxes you are building a 'protection' against a potentially high liability if you were planning to sell a building that was a commercial building and would have Capital Gains. Or you sold stock at a profit that would also put you in the Capital Gain area.  You won a large sum in a lottery, the refund could cushion a bit of the tax. In short, if you think you will have a tax liability in the current year then on the tax return you are filing for the year that just past, it may be to your benefit to apply the refund.  If you owe money  from a prior year, the refund will not be sent to you so you will not be able to roll it forward.    One specific example is you did qualify in the prior year for the ACA.  If in the year you are currently in- before you file your taxes-- you realize that you will have to pay at the end of the current year, then assigning your refund will pay part or all of the liability. Keep in mind that the 'tax' imposed due to ACA is only collected from your refunds.  If you keep having a liability to pay  or have no refunds due to you, the liability is not collected from you.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Your cash back from the previous year might reduce your upcoming tax obligations, particularly if you're a Schedule \"C\" report filer. You create a financial safety-net by allocating your refund towards your future taxes, especially if you're contemplating selling a commercial property that would generate Capital Gains, or perhaps trading stocks for profit which would also result in Capital Gains. If you hit the jackpot in a lottery, the refund could soften the tax impact. Essentially, if you anticipate owing taxes, assigning your previous year's refund might be advantageous when submitting the recent year's tax return. However, if you're in debt from the previous year, the refund won't be distributed to you, preventing you from carrying it over to the next year. So, for instance, if you qualified for the ACA in the previous year and foresee that you'll owe money by the end of the current year before tax filing, devoting your refund could compensate for part or all of your obligations. Remember, any 'tax' levied due to ACA is only collected from your refunds. If you persistently have a tax liability or don’t receive refunds, the tax won't be collected from you.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Here's one reason that's being overlooked in answers so far. (@ChrisInEdmonton, this is for your comment on @Chad's answer.) How do credit card companies make money? Sure, there's interest charges, but those are offset significantly by the cost of borrowing money, and by people defaulting on their debt / entering bankruptcy. The other way they make money is by processing transactions. They get a cut of whatever you buy. If you're a high-income person, and you're going to process a lot of expenditures with this credit card, your business is worth more. They will be willing to bribe you with things like cash-back, frequent flier miles, and insurance on your auto rentals, so that they can be your #1 go-to card.  (This works in concert with the way that some credit card vendors with richer clientele overall - American Express - get to charge higher merchant fees for access to these customers' wallets. But that was mentioned in other answers.) If you're not a high-income person, your business is worth less. If you go somewhere asking for credit, they're going to try and give you a card which will earn them the most money - which probably isn't the one where they give you back 50% of their transaction fee in rewards. It's a calculated risk, since they still have to compete against cash, debit cards, and all the other credit card companies, so they don't have you totally over a barrel, but you shouldn't expect as many freebies, either.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Let's discuss a frequently missed explanation as to how credit card companies generate revenue. (@ChrisInEdmonton, this is a response to the feedback on @Chad's post.) What are credit card companies' revenue streams? Yes, charging interest is one part, but it is somewhat balanced by the expense of lending and the risk of clients failing to repay their debt or filing for insolvency. The alternative method of income generation is from facilitating purchases where they earn a fraction of every transaction. High-income individuals offer a profitable line of business as their propensity to make a high volume of transactions with the card is greater. Consequently, the companies tend to entice such big spenders with benefits like cash back, air miles, and auto rental insurance, making their card a preferred choice. (This is indirectly influenced by how some credit card providers like American Express, known for their wealthier client base, can demand higher transaction fees from merchants.) However, for those with lower income, the value they bring is comparatively less. Such individuals will most likely be advised to opt for a card that maximizes the company's profits rather than one that frequently offers sizable rewards or cash backs. The competition with cash transactions, debit cards, and other credit card businesses forces the companies to consider their risks carefully, ensuring they don't completely ostracize you, but don't anticipate a plethora of perks. \n",

      "Reference Response:  It is basically the same situation what US was when the crash happened. People took on debt without the means to pay, even with awful credit records. But the problem isn't the debt people take on themselves, but with the limited disposable income they have how efficiently can their debts be serviced. And how do banks who lend out money can recover their money. When banks lend money to all and sundry, they have to take care of defaults and that is when financial wizardry comes into play. In US people have the option to default on their debt and refinance it, so banks assumed default and tried to hedge their risks. If this is an option in Australia, be ready for a crash else not to worry about much. If banks continue lending expect higher inflation rates, higher interest rates and maybe a downgrade of bonds issued by the Australian government. Higher import costs and a boom in exports because of devalued Australian dollar.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Essentially, it mirrors the scenario of the US during the financial collapse. People procured debts they didn't have the capacity to repay, often even with pathetic credit histories. Nevertheless, the real issue doesn't lie with the debt individuals acquire, but rather with their minimal disposable income and the effectiveness of their debt management. Additionally, it questions how banks can reclaim their funds after providing loans indiscriminately - that's where the magic of finance steps in. U.S. citizens have the luxury of defaulting and renegotiating their debt, leading banks to predict these defaults and try to mitigate the hazards. If this choice exists in Australia, prepare for a crash, otherwise the concern is minimal. Continuous lending by banks likely indicates increased inflation rates, rising interest interests, and potential downgrading of Australian government bonds. Expect a surge in import expenses and export growth due to the decreased value of the Australian dollar.\n",

      "Reference Response:  You need to pay off the entire balance of 7450 as soon as possible. This should be your primary financial goal at this point above anything else. A basic structure that you can follow is this: Is the £1500 balance with the 39.9% interest rate the obvious starting point here? Yes, that is fine. But all the cards and overdraft debts need to be treated with the same urgency! What are the prospects for improving my credit score in say the next 6-12 months enough to get a 0% balance transfer or loan for consolidation? This should not be a primary concern of yours if you want to move on with your financial life. Debt consolidation will not help you achieve the goals you have described (home ownership, financial stability). If you follow the advice here, by the time you get to the point of being eligible, you may not see enough savings in interest to make it worth the hassle. Focus on the hard stuff and pay off the balances. Is that realistic, or am I looking at a longer term struggle? You are looking at a significant struggle. If it was easy you would not be asking this question! The length of time will be determined by your choices: how aggressively you will cut your lifestyle, take on extra jobs, and place additional payments on your debt.  By being that extreme, you will actually start to see progress, which will be encouraging. If you go in half-committed, your progress will show as much and it will be demotivating. Much of your success will hinge on your mental and emotional toughness to push through the hard work of delaying pleasure and paying off these balances. That is just my personal experience, so you can take it or leave it. :) The credit score will take care of itself if you follow this method, so don't worry about it. Good Luck!\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  It's crucial to swiftly settle the total due of 7450. Place this at the forefront of your fiscal objectives, before anything else is considered. Here's an uncomplicated plan you might consider: Is it okay to kick off with the £1500 liability at an interest rate of 39.9%? Indeed, that works. However, every card and overdraft liability shares the same criticalness! Could my credit rating enhance potentially in the forthcoming half to a year enough for a 0% balance transfer or a consolidation loan? This need not be a predominant worry for you if you're serious about advancing financially. Merging debts won't usher you towards the goals you've outlined (securing a house, becoming financially stable). Should you heed this counsel, upon eligibility, you may realize the saving in interest isn't substantial enough to merit the effort. Prioritize paying the tough debts and clearing balances. Does that seem feasible or am I looking at an extended hardship? You're staring at considerable hardship. If it was a piece of cake, you wouldn't query! The duration would hinge on the decisions you make; the intensity of your lifestyle adjustments, the extra work you undertake, and the increase in your debt repayments. By adopting such drastic measures, you'll soon witness encouraging advancements. Half-hearted attempts will mirror in your growth and demotivate you. A huge chunk of your victory will rely on your psychological resilience and emotional grit to muscle through the tough grind of delaying gratification and settling these debts. That being said, this is merely my personal viewpoint, take it with a pinch of salt. :) Let the credit score naturally take course if you follow this protocol, there's no need for concern.

The someone else who bought your shares evidently disagrees with your assessment. Did you sell because the company didn't earn a profit at all? Did it not earn a profit because it's in a dead-end business that is slowly but inevitably declining to zero? Something like Sears Holdings?

Did you sell because the company made a profit, but it was lower than expected? Did they make a lower-than-expected profit because of lower sales? Why were the sales lower? Is the industry declining? Was the snow too heavy to send the construction crews out? Did the company make a big investment to build a new plant that will, in a few years, yield even higher sales and profits? What are the profits year-over-year? Increasing? Declining? Usually, investors are willing to pay a premium, that is more than expected, for a stock in a company with robust growth.

Alternatively, they might be a company in an industry yet to explode with profitability, like Tesla. Maybe you sold because the company was profitable but not as much as projected. Could the reduced profit be a result of lower sales, or simply because heavy snowfall prevented the construction team from working? Perhaps, the company made a substantial investment in building a new plant, which could lead to massive sales and earnings in future. How has the profit trend been over the years? Rising? Falling?

For SGY, they closed at $6.95, and opened at $32.80, so your five shares at $6.95 would now be one share at $32.80, so you would have actually lost money (not purely because of the split, but because the \"new\" shares are trading lower then the expected 1:5 split price).  A split in general does not affect market cap (how much your total shares are worth) but there may be residual effects that cause the market value to fluctuate after a split that affect the price.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Should I have anticipated these companies' raises and invested in their stocks yesterday? Definitely not. With DZSI, for instance, your ownership of 5 stocks purchased at $1.10 each would have decreased to just 1 stock priced at $5.50, leaving your overall investment stagnant. In the case of SGY, the circumstances are even more dismal; the stock which closed at $6.95 each surged to an opening value of $32.80. As a result, your initial five stocks bought at $6.95 would have contracted to one stock at $32.80, causing you to suffer a loss. This isn't solely due to the split—it's because the replacement shares sell for less than the anticipated equivalent of one-fifth the price after the split.

      "Reference Response:  I pretty much only use my checking. What's the downside? Checking accounts don't pay as much interest as savings account. Oh, but wait, interest rates have been zero for nearly 10 years. So there is very little benefit to keeping money in my savings account. In fact, I had two savings accounts, and Well Fargo closed one of them because I hadn't used it in years. Downsides of savings accounts: You are limited to 5 transfers per month into or out of them. No such limit with checking. Upsides of savings accounts: Well, maybe you will be less likely to spend the money. Why don't you just have your pay go into your checking and then just transfer \"extra money\" out of it, rather than the reverse? If you want to put money \"away\" so that you save it, assuming you're in the U.S.A., open a traditional IRA. Max deposit of $5500/year, and it reduces your taxable income. It's not a bad idea to have a separate account that you don't touch except for in an emergency. But, for me, the direction of flow is from work, to checking, to savings.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I mostly rely on my current account. Can there be any potential pitfalls? Certainly, the return rate from a checking account isn't as high as that from a savings account. Considering the fact that interest rates have stayed stagnant at zero for the past decade, hoarding cash in my savings account yields minimal profit. I once owned a pair of savings accounts, one of which Wells Fargo terminated due to my lack of use over several years. The limitations of savings accounts include a restriction to five monthly transfers. There's no such boundary with checking accounts. The upside of saving accounts, however, is that it might discourage reckless spending. A better approach might be to direct your salary into your checking account first and then move the surplus to your savings account, rather than the other way around. To stash away money for savings in the United States, think about opening a standard IRA. The limit is $5500 per year, and it can reduce your taxable earnings. It's a decent strategy to maintain a separate account for emergencies. Yet, in my case, the cash flow goes from my job, to my checking account, and then into my savings.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The actual price is represented on charts and not the change in price as a percentage, because it is the actual price which is used in all other parts of analysis (both technical and fundamental), and it is the actual figure the security is bought and sold at. A change in price has to be relative to a previous price at a previous time, and we can easily work out the change in price over any given time period. I think what you are concerned about is how to compare a certain actual price change in low priced securities to the same actual price change in a higher priced securities.  For example: $1.00 rise in a $2.00 stock representing a 50% increase in price; $1.00 rise in a $10.00 stock representing a 10% increase in price. On a standard chart both of these look the same, as they both show a $1.00 increase in price. So what can we do to show the true representation of the percentage increase in price? It is actually quite simple. You view the chart using a log scale instead of a standard scale (most charting packages should have this option). What may look like a bubble on a standard scale chart, looks like a healthy uptrend on a log scale chart and represents a true picture of the percentage change in price. Example of Standard Price Scale VS LOG Price Scale on a Chart Standard Price Scale  On the standard scale the price seems to have very little movement from Mar09 to Jan12 and then the price seems to zoom up after Jan12 to Mar13. This is because a 4% increase (for example) of $0.50 is only $0.02, whilst a 4% increase of $7.00 $0.28, so the increases seem much bigger at the end of the chart. LOG Price Scale  On the LOG chart however, these price changes seem to be more evenly displayed no matter at what price level the price change has occurred at. This thus give a better representation of how fast or slow the price is rising or falling, or the size of the change in price.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The depicted value in graphs is the actual cost and not the shift in price percentage-wise, because it's this actual cost that informs remaining elements of examination (both technical and fundamental). The true cost is significant as it's the price at which the security is purchased or sold. Alteration in price requires a baseline from a preceding cost at an earlier interval, and we can effortlessly calculate this shift in price for any specific timeframe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your concern might be about how to put side by side an identical absolute price transformation in low priced securities compared to the same price alteration in high-end securities. Take for instance, a $1.00 surge in a leanly priced $2.0 stock, signifying a 50% upturn in price. Contrast that with another $1.00 rise in a costlier $10.0 stock, marking a 10% price increment. Standard charts present these instances identically since both show a $1.00 price surge. Now, how can we accurately display the proportionate price increase?\n",
      "\n",
      "The solution is fairly straightforward—look at the chart using a logarithmic scale as an alternative to a standard one (a feature most charting software have). What appears to be a bubble on a standard scale chart appears as a steady climb on a logarithmic scale chart, giving an accurate depiction of the percentage price change. \n",
      "\n",
      "Take for instance a chart comparison between Standard Price Scale and Logarithmic Price Scale. On the standard scale from Mar09 to Jan12, prices seem to just crawl upwards, then appears to skyrocket from Jan12 to Mar13. This is because the shift from a 4% increase of $0.50 ($0.02) to a 4% increase of $7.00 ($0.28) makes increases towards the end appear more drastic. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, on the Logarithmic scale, these adjustments appear evenly distributed regardless of the dollar value at which the change occurred. This offers a clearer picture of the pace of price alteration, be it an uptick or decrease, and the magnitude of the price change.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Before doing anything else: you want a lawyer involved right from the beginning, to make sure that something reasonable happens with the house if one of you dies or leaves. Seriously, you'll both be safer and happier if it's all explicit. How much you should put on the house is not the right question. Houses don't sell instantly, and while you can access some of their stored value by borrowing against them that too can take some time to arrange. You need to have enough operating capital for normal finances, plus an emergency reserve to cover unexpectedly being out of work or sudden medical expenses. There are suggestions for how much that should be in answers to other questions. After that, the question is whether you should really be buying a house at all. It isn't always a better option than renting and (again as discussed in answers to other questions) there are ongoing costs in time and upkeep and taxes and insurance. If you're just thinking about the financials, it may be better to continue to rent and to invest the savings in the market. The time to buy a house is when you have the money and a reliable income, plan not to move for at least five years, really want the advantages of more elbow room and the freedom to alter the place to suit your needs (which will absorb more money)...  As far as how much to put down vs. finance: you really want a down payment of at least 20%. Anything less than that, and the bank will insist you pay for mortgage insurance, which is a significant expense. Whether you want to pay more than that out of your savings depends on how low an interest rate you can get (this is a good time in that regard) versus how much return you are getting on your investments, combined with how long you want the mortgage to run and how large a mortgage payment you're comfortable committing to. If you've got a good investment plan in progress and can get a mortgage which charges a lower interest rate than your investments can reasonably be expected to pay you, putting less down and taking a larger mortgage is one of the safer forms of leveraged investing... IF you're comfortable with that. If the larger mortgage hanging over you is going to make you uncomfortable,  this might not be a good answer for you. It's a judgement call. I waited until i'd been in out of school about 25 years before I was ready to buy a house. Since i'd been careful with my money over that time,  I had enough in investments that I could have bought the house for cash. Or I could have gone the other way and financed 80% of it for maximum leverage. I decided that what I was comfortable with was financing 50%. You'll have to work thru the numbers and decide what you are comfortable with. But I say again, if buying shared property you need a lawyer involved. It may be absolutely the right thing to do ... but you want to make sure everything is fully spelled out... and you'll also want appropriate terms written into your wills. (Being married would carry some automatic assumptions about joint ownership and survivor rights... but even then it's safer to make it all explicit.) Edit: Yes, making a larger down payment may let you negotiate a lower interest rate on the loan. You'll have to find out what each bank is willing to offer you, or work with a mortgage broker who can explore those options for you.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  As an initial step, procuring legal counsel is advised to ensure that should a split or demise occur, the result is fair. Without a doubt, clear, agreed-upon plans create a safer, happier environment for all. The primary question isn't about how much to invest in the property. The reality is, houses aren't sold overnight, and releasing their hidden value by borrowing against them also takes time to set up. Therefore, it's vital to maintain a sufficient financial buffer for routine expenses and a contingency fund for unforeseen unemployment or health crises. A number of these reserves are addressed in responses to other inquiries. Thereafter, the real question becomes whether you should be purchasing a property at all. Renting continues to be a fair contender, given factors like maintenance costs, property taxes, and insurance. Purely from a financial point of view, it might seem wiser to continue leasing and invest your savings elsewhere. The ideal time to buy a house is when your finances are steady, you're committed to staying for at least five years, and you can see the benefits of having more freedom and space, accepting that it comes with financial commitments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concerning the down payment versus finance debate, ideally, you would want a minimum of 20% down payment. If it's less than that, the bank will insist on costly mortgage insurance. Whether you wish to dip more into your savings depends on factors such as the obtainable interest rate, your investment returns, the desired length of your mortgage, and affordable mortgage payments. Suppose you have a sound investment plan and secure a mortgage with an interest rate lower than the return on your investments. In that case, it might be safer to contribute less and increase the mortgage... IF that's a comfortable approach for you. If the prospect of a large mortgage unnerves you, this might not be the right direction for you. It's a matter of preference. I waited a considerable amount of time post-school before buying a house. Because I had managed my finances well, I had enough saved in investments to buy the house outright or finance 80% of the cost. Ultimately, I was comfortable financing 50%. You have to crunch your numbers and determine your comfort level. But I reiterate, for shared property purchases, involving a lawyer is crucial. It might be the best decision... but it's essential to ensure everything is clearly stated... and it's wise to include suitable conditions in your wills. Even marriage implies mutual ownership and survivor benefits... but it's always better to be explicit. Note: A larger down payment can potentially give you some wiggle room for lower loan interest rates. It's advisable to investigate what each bank is willing to offer, or secure a mortgage broker who can do that groundwork for you.\n",

      "Reference Response:  A more serious problem: how do you know who's really buying your stock? \"Shell companies\" are an increasingly obvious problem in corporate and tax accountability. There are jurisdictions where companies can be created with secret lists of directors and shareholders. If stock is bought by one of these companies, it is very hard to trace it to a particular individual.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  An escalating dilemma: determining the actual purchaser of your equity shares. The rise of \"dummy corporations\" posits a progressively detected issue in the sectors of corporate responsibility and tax accounting.

In general, banks won't accept \"large\" stale checks. The meaning of \"large\" varies -- $25,000 in NYC, as little as $2k in other places. Banks that service high-volume check issuers (like rebate companies) reject checks at 180 days. For business purposes, I think some banks will create accounts for specific mailings or other purposes as well. (i.e. 2011 refund account) The accounts close after a year.\n",

Banks providing services to entities with high check issuance (like refund firms) decline checks at the six-month mark. For corporate functionalities, I believe some banks establish unique accounts for particular campaigns or other uses, such as a \"2011 rebate account.\" These accounts generally shut down after twelve months.

      "Reference Response:  “Why do governments borrow money instead of printing it? (When printing money, one doesn't need to pay interest).”  Good question.  Numerous leading economists, including a couple of economics Nobel Laureates have asked the same question and concluded that borrowing can be dispensed with. First, Milton Freidman set out a monetary system in a paper in the American Economic Review which involved no government borrowing, and govt just printed money (in a responsible fashion of course) as and when needed.  See: http://www.jstor.org/pss/1810624 A second Nobel Laureate with similar views was William Vickrey. A third economist with similar views (of Keynes’ era) was Abba Lerner. Keynes said of Lerner, “Lerner's argument is impeccable, but heaven help anyone who tries to put it across to the plain man at this stage of the evolution of our ideas”.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  \"Why do states opt to take on debt rather than produce more cash? (There's no requirement to cater for the interest when money is created anew).\" This piqued the interest of celebrated economists, inclusive of Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences winners, who've deliberated over this question and reached the understanding that taking up debt could potentially be avoided. Primarily, Milton Freidman devised a monetary framework in an article released in the American Economic Review where he proposed that the government needn't borrow, but should instead mint money (responsibly, needless to say) whenever necessary. See: http://www.jstor.org/pss/1810624 Alike viewpoints were also shared by William Vickrey, another Nobel Prize laureate. Abba Lerner was an additional economist from the era of Keynes who promoted such a perspective.

      "Reference Response:  It totally depends on when your expenses hit and whether you might have a larger stock than necessary. If you run your projections against the monthly save and the intervals of when you'll need the money, you might be able to extract some stock from the account.  I recommend making this a bit simpler. I operate this with an \"annuals\" account which is a complete aggregate of expenses that I know I have several times per year (or once every two years), but are not monthly or part of a weekly non-fixed expense budget cap. Instead of tracking each expense individually and saving for it, create a spreadsheet that lists out all of these expenses, sum them, and then divide by 12. When I first opened this account, I added a one-time deposit to \"catchup\" to make sure I would never need to pull money from another source for these expenses. As new expenses come into existence that I should plan for annually, I simply add them to this list and adjust the monthly auto-deposit to the account. This also adjusts my single number weekly budget.  To make it easy, whenever I see an expense on my annuals list on my amex or debit, I simply initiate a withdrawal from the annuals savings and it will balance out my weekly or monthly budget expenses.  The goal of my annuals account is to simply avoid anti-windfalls that are known quantities (insurance, annual eye exam, sprinkler flush, amazon prime, etc) that would throw a wrench in weekly/monthly budget and expense planning. The more variables you can remove from your weekly/monthly, the more regular it becomes and the more likely you will be able to stick to a budget.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Depending on when your costs occur and whether your inventory might be larger than needed, it's possible you may be able to withdraw some stock from the account. It's beneficial to simplify this process by utilising an \"annuals\" account. This account encompasses the various, non-regular expenses incurred once or several times a year but are not tracked weekly or monthly. Rather than individually saving for each cost, compile them into a spreadsheet, calculate their sum, then split by 12. Upon creating this account, I made a unique deposit to ensure I wouldn't need to utilize other resources for these expenses. As additional yearly costs arise, they are added to the list and the monthly automatic deposit is updated. This in turn modifies my standard weekly budget. To make things simpler, when an expense on my annuals list appears on my account, I just initiate a transfer from the annuals savings to level out my weekly or monthly budget expenses. The aim of my annuals account is to evade predictable costs (insurance, annual eye exam, sprinkler clean, amazon prime, etc.) that could interrupt weekly/monthly expense planning. Eliminating as many variables as possible from weekly/monthly planning regularizes the process and enhances your ability to stick to a budget.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Congratulations for achieving an important step in the road to financial freedom. Some view extending loan payment of loans that allow the deduction of interest as a good thing. Some view the hit on the credit score by prematurely paying off an installment loan as a bad thing.  Determining the order of paying off multiple loans in conjunction with the reality of income, required monthly living expense, and the need to save for emergencies is highly individualized.  Keeping an artificial debt seems to make little sense, it is an expensive insurance policy to chase a diminishing tax benefit and boost to a credit score. Keep in mind it is a deduction, not a credit, so how much you save depends on your tax bracket.  It might make sense for somebody to extend the loan out for an extra year or two, but you can't just assume that that advice applies in your situation. Personally I paid off my student loan early, as soon as it made sense based on my income, and my situation. I am glad I did, but for others the opposite made more sense.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Kudos on reaching a milestone towards fiscal independence. Some believe prolonging repayment of interest-deductible loans is advantageous. Others perceive the premature clearance of installment loans, impacting the credit rating negatively, as unfortunate. The sequence of settling down multiple debts, considering income realities, mandatory living costs, and emergency savings necessity is a personal matter. Upholding unneeded debt seems nonsensical - it's costly coverage to pursue fading tax advantages and an improved credit rating. Consider that it's a deduction, not a credit, meaning your savings depend on your tax group. It might seem logical for some to lengthen the loan term by a couple of more years, but it's incorrect to presume that such advice is universally applicable. I tackled my education loan ahead of time because it seemed reasonable according to my earnings and circumstances. Though it worked for me, others found it sensible to take the opposite approach.\n",

Edited: The definition of the word in this case meaning \"something used or serving to point out; a sign, token, or indication\" from Meaning  #3 I presume therefore you are asking what an index is? There are many variations of what makes up an Index but in short it is a representation of some part of a market. An extremely simplistic calculation would be to take a basket of stocks, and sum their prices.  If one stock moves up a dollar, and one moves down a dollar, the index has effectively not changed, as it is presumed that the loss in one is offset by the gain in the other.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Reflecting on your query about the term \"index\", let's delve into its significance. In essence, an index is a symbolic representation of a specific section of a market, created through various methods. Let's say, we select a group of stocks and sum up their prices to simplify it to its core. If one particular stock escalates in price by a dollar, while another decreases by the same amount, it can be assumed that they balance each other out, keeping the index constant.

      "Reference Response:  The important thing to realize is, what would you do, if you didn't have the call? If you didn't have call options, but you wanted to have a position in that particular stock, you would have to actually purchase it. But, having purchased the shares, you are at risk to lose up to the entire value of them-- if the company folded or something like that.  A call option reduces the potential loss, since you are at worst only out the cost of the call, and you also lose a little on the upside, since you had to pay for the call, which will certainly have some premium over buying the underlying share directly. Risk can be defined as reducing the variability of outcomes, so since calls/shorts etc. reduce potential losses and also slightly reduce potential gains, they pretty much by definition reduce risk. It's also worth noting, that when you buy a call, the seller could also be seen as hedging the risk of price decreases while also guaranteeing that they have a buyer at a certain price. So, they may be more concerned about having cash flow at the right time, while at the same time reducing the cost of the share losing in value than they are losing the potential upside if you do exercise the option. Shorts work in the same way but opposite direction to calls, and forwards and futures contracts are more about cash flow management: making sure you have the right amount of money in the right currency at the right time regardless of changes in the costs of raw materials or currencies. While either party may lose on the transaction due to price fluctuations, both parties stand to gain by being able to know exactly what they will get, and exactly what they will have to pay for it, so that certainty is worth something, and certainly better for some firms than leaving positions exposed. Of course you can use them for speculative purposes, and a good number of firms/people do but that's not really why they were invented.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Consider this: what if you didn't have the call? Without call options and still desiring a stake in a given stock, you'd need to buy it outright. This purchase exposes you to potentially losing the stock's entire value if the company goes under for any reason. However, a call option alleviates some possible loss - your maximum liability is the call's cost. Although, you might sacrifice a bit of the upward potential as the call option cost would be a premium over the direct share purchase. We identify risk as lessening the variability of results. Consequently, call options and shorts decrease potential losses and marginally lessen potential gains, inherently reducing risk. It's equally relevant that the call option seller counts on a fixed buyer for a specific price while warding off the risk of price decreases. They might prioritize securing cash flow at the right time over worrying about share value reduction or missing possible profits if you exercise the option. Just like call options, shorts operate inversely, and futures contracts primarily focus on cash flow control: ensuring the right sum of money in the correct currency at the appropriate time, indifferent to changes in raw materials' prices or exchange rates. While price changes could lead to losses for either party, both stand to benefit from transaction certainty, knowing exactly what they'll receive and the cost. This certainty provides value and can offer some firms an advantage over leaving positions vulnerable. While these methods can serve speculative purposes and several firms or individuals use them for this reason, that's not precisely their original purpose.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Given that the 6 answers all advocate similar information, let me offer you the alternate scenario - You earn $60K and have an employer offering a 50% match on all deposits. All deposits. (Note, I recently read a Q&A here describing such an offer. If I see it again, I'll link).  Let the thought of the above settle in. You think about the fact that $42K isn't a bad salary, and decide to deposit 30%, to gain the full match on your $18K deposit. Now, you budget to live your life, pay your bills, etc, but it's tight. When you accumulate $2000, and a strong want comes up (a toy, a trip, anything, no judgement) you have a tough decision. You think to yourself, \"after the match, I am literally saving 45% of my income. I'm on a pace to have the ability to retire in 20 years. Why do I need to save even more?\"  Your budget has enough discretionary spending that if you have a $2000 'emergency', you charge it and pay it off over the next 6-8 months. Much larger, and you know that your super-funded 401(k) has the ability to tap a loan. Your choice to turn away from the common wisdom has the recommended $20K (about 6 months of your spending) sitting in your 401(k), pretax deposited as $26K, and matched to nearly $40K, growing long term.  Note: This is a devil's advocate answer. Had I been the first to answer, it would reflect the above.  In my own experience, when I got married, we built up the proper emergency fund. As interest rates fell, we looked at our mortgage balance, and agreed that paying down the loan would enable us to refinance and save enough in mortgage interest that the net effect was as if we were getting 8% on the money. At the same time as we got that new mortgage, the bank offered a HELOC, which I never needed to use. Did we somehow create high risk? Perhaps. Given that my wife and I were both still working, and had similar incomes, it seemed reasonable.\n",

You reason that a $42K salary isn't too shabby and opt to deposit 30%, availing the total match on your $18K deposit. As you now navigate through your tight budget to live, settle bills, etc., it gets tricky. Whenever you amass $2000, and a strong urge arrives (a new gadget, a holiday, anything, not judging), you face a conundrum. \"After getting the matching funds, I'm essentially stashing away 45% of my pay. I'm on track to retire in just two decades, do I need to save even more?\" You brood. Your budget holds enough flexible spending for a $2000 'unforeseen expense', which you handle by charging and repaying over half a year to 8 months. For more significant costs, there's a provision for a loan from your considerably stacked 401(k). Veering from popular advice has landed you with around $20K (almost half a year of your expenses) in your 401(k). The equivalent of a tax-free deposit of $26K, matched almost to $40K, progressing for the long term. Disclaimer: This is merely presenting an alternative perspective. I would have likely mirrored this advice having been the first respondent. Relating from my life, when we tied the knot, we collected a substantial emergency fund. As interest rates dropped, we inspected our mortgage balance and agreed to paying off the loan, which would allow us to refinance and net enough mortgage interest savings equivalent to an 8% return. Similarly, when we refinanced, the bank propositioned a HELOC, which we never had to use. Had we potentially incurred heavy risks? Maybe. Considering both my spouse and I were employment-steady and had comparable income, it seemed plausible.\n",

      "Reference Response:  One reason for this is that many people don't simply allow their houses to rot and decay. If you're talking about a house built in 1980 and left vacant and unmaintained for 35 years, it probably will be in pretty poor shape.  But a homeowner generally wants to preserve their house and maintain it in good condition, so they invest in things like new roofs, siding, gutters, windows, paint, exterminators, new furnaces, hot water heaters, air conditioners, etc... All this stuff costs money (and for tax purposes, can often be factored into the cost basis of the house when it is sold), but it maintains the value of the property. A small hole in the roof may be fairly cheap to fix, but if left unrepaired, it could eventually cause much of the building to rot, making the structure near worthless. If a car slams into your living room, you don't generally leave it there; most people repair the damage.  It's not uncommon in some areas to have 100 year old houses (or 300+ year old houses in some countries) that were built well in the first place and have been well maintained in the interim.  People also renovate their homes, ripping out outdated construction and appliances and sometimes building new additions, decks, porches, etc... This also serves to make the property more attractive and increases its value.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The state of a home tends to deteriorate when it is not preserved. For instance, a home constructed in 1980 that has been uninhabited and neglected for over three decades will likely be in terrible shape. However, homeowners have a tendency to care for their homes, and this prompts them to spend on improvements such as new roofing, side panels, drains, window panes, coats of paint, pest control, modern heating systems, hot water facilities, and air conditioning units, among other things. Such expenses can be significant but they serve to retain and increase the real estate's worth. For instance, a minor leakage in the roof could drop its value substantially if not addressed promptly, as it could speed up the decay of the structure, reducing its worth to virtually zero. When an accident such as a car crashing into a house occurs, the routine response is to repair it right away. In certain regions, it isn't unusual to see homes of a century (or even older in some countries) that were initially of good quality and have been kept in good shape since. Homeowners also update their homes by replacing old structures and appliances, and at times constructing new sections, patios, verandas, and so forth, increasing the resale value and appeal of the property.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I think a greater problem would be the protection of your property right.  China hasn't shown much respect for the property rights of its own citizens - moving people off subsistence farms in order to build high-rise apartments - so I'm not certain that a foreigner could expect much protection.  A first consideration in any asset purchase should always be consideration of the strength of local property law.  By all accounts, China fails.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I believe your primary concern should be securing the rights to your property. It's no secret that China doesn't hold the highest regard for the property rights of its residents, often dislocating individuals from self-sufficient farms to construct towering apartments - raising questions if an outsider would receive any better protection. A vital part of considering any asset acquisition should be evaluating the integrity of local property laws. By all standards, China is not up to par.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Look at the basic cost of the lease.  Option 1: keep the car for three years. Pay for repairs during that time then sell it for $7,000. Option 2: Sell the current car for $10,000. Lease a new car for three years. Assume no need for repairs during those three years. At the end of the three years return the car in return for $0. Cost of option 1 is $3000 plus repairs.  Cost of Option 2 is 36 months x monthly lease cost. The first $83 of the monthly lease cost is to cover the $3000 fixed cost of option 1. The rest of the monthly lease cost is to cover the cost of repairs. Also remember that some leases have a initial down payment due at signing, and penalties for condition, and excess mileage. The lease company may also require a higher level of insurance for the lease to cover their investment if you have an accident.  Plus If you fall in love with a different car two year from now, or your needs change you are locked in until the end of the lease period.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Examine the fundamental expense associated with the lease. Pathway 1: Retain the vehicle for a trio of years, cover the repair costs during this period and then trade it for $7,000. Pathway 2: Offload the existing vehicle for $10,000. Begin a fresh lease agreement for another three years with a new vehicle, banking on the lack of need for maintenance in this term. After the three-year stretch, surrender the car for $0. The cost for Pathway 1 sums up to $3000, along with added repair expenses. Conversely, the cost for Pathway 2 is multiplied by 36 months in accordance to the monthly lease cost. Be aware that the initial $83 allocated every month is to offset the $3000 initial cost from option 1, whilst the remaining monthly lease amount serves to meet the probable repair expenses. Bear in mind, certain lease agreements necessitate an up-front deposit, with penalties for excessive mileage or poor vehicle condition. The leasing firm may also demand higher insurance coverage to protect their investment in case of an accident. Moreover, if you happen to fancy a different car or your requirements alter dramatically, you are constrained till the lease tenure concludes.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Generally, a one time thing is considered a gift. For the donor this is obviously not a deductible expense, except for some specific cases (for example promotional gifts under $25 to vendors can be deducted, if you're a business, or charitable contributions to a recognized charity). However, if this is a regular practice - that would not be considered as a gift, but rather as a tax fraud, a criminal offense. Being attentive I would like to make a little gift or give some little   (<100$) amount of money (cash/wire/online) for that Why? Generally, gift is exempt from income if no services were provided and the gift was made in good faith. In the situation you describe this doesn't hold. When the gift is exempt from income to the receiver - the donor pays the tax (in this case, below exemption the tax is zero). If the gift is not exempt from income to the receiver - it is no longer a gift and the receiver is paying income taxes, not the donor. The situation you describe is a classic tax evasion scheme. If someone does it consistently and regularly (as a receiver, donor, or both) - he would likely end up in jail.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In general, if you give something once, it's viewed as a contribution. Of course, this isn't something that you can remove from your expenses, with a few exceptions (like if you give a promotional gift to a supplier under $25 as a business or donate to a recognized charity). Yet if this becomes a normal procedure - it isn't seen as a gift anymore, instead it becomes a tax scam, a punishable crime. For the sake of being careful, I'd like to present a small token or offer a small sum (<100$) in different ways (cash/bank transfer/online), but why? Usually, a gift doesn't fall under income if no services were provided and the gift was made genuinely. That doesn't seem to be the case in the context you've mentioned. When the gift isn't counted under the receiver's income - the giver deals with the tax (no tax under the exemption in this scenario). If the gift counts under the receiver's income - it ceases being a gift and the receiver needs to pay income taxes, not the giver. The case you're describing resembles a typical tax evasion plot. If a person repeatedly does this (as a receiver, giver, or both) - they'll likely find themselves imprisoned.\n",

See list here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_code In some countries the numbers are given by Central Bank.   To enable internationl payments, the SWIFT body apart from message formats, allocated a  SWIFT BIC [Bank identification Code] so that Banks can be globally identified.

The clearing house route the payments or collection instruments to the correct Bank on the basis of this number.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The count of banking institutions is on the rise globally, and this necessitates an identification system. The United States refers to these as ABA numbers, sanctioned by the American Bankers Association, while the United Kingdom uses Sort Codes, and this pattern is mirrored in other nations too – more details can be found on this list: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_code. In specific instances, these identifiers are issued by the country's Central Bank. In addressing the challenge of international transactions, the SWIFT organization has tacitly agreed to offer SWIFT BIC [Bank Identification Code] to ensure Banks' global recognition. At the time being, IBAN is gaining acceptance in Europe and New Zealand to facilitate the unique global identification of a Bank Account. In short, these numerical identifiers subtly assist in distinguishing a particular Bank/Branch/Location.

      "Reference Response:  I don't know why stocks in some industries tend to have lower prices per share than others. It doesn't really matter much. Whether a company has 1,000,0000 shares selling for $100 each, or 10,000,000 shares selling for $10 each, either way the total value is the same. Companies generally like to keep the share price relatively low so that if someone wants to buy a small amount, they can. Like if the price was $10,000 per share, than an investor with less than $10,000 to put in that one stock would be priced out of the market. If it's $10, then if someone wants $10 they can buy one share, and if someone wants $10,000 they can buy 1000 shares. As to why energy stocks are volatile, I can think of several reasons. One, in our current world, energy is highly susceptible to politics. A lot of the world's energy comes from the Middle East, which is a notoriously unstable region. Any time there's conflict there, energy supplies from the region become uncertain. Oil-producing countries may embargo countries that they don't like. A war will, at the very least, interfere with transportation and shipping, and may result in oil wells being destroyed. Etc. Two, energy is consumed when you use it, and most consumers have very limited ability to stockpile. So you're constantly buying the energy you need as you need it. So if demand goes down, it is reflected immediately. Compare this to, say, clothing. Most people expect to keep the same clothes for years, wearing them repeatedly. (Hopefully washing them now and then!) So if for some reason you decided today that you only need three red shirts instead of four, this might not have any immediate impact on your buying. It could be months before you would have bought a new red shirt anyway. There is a tendency for the market to react rather slowly to changes in demand for shirts. But with energy, if you decide you only need to burn 3 gallons of gas per week instead of 4, your consumption goes down immediately, within days. Three, really adding to number two, energy is highly perishable, especially some forms of energy. If a solar power station is capable of producing 10 megawatts but today there is only demand for 9 megawatts, you can't save the unused megawatt for some future time when demand is higher. It's gone. (You can charge a battery with it, but that's pretty limited.) You can pile up coal or store natural gas in a tank until you need it, but you can't save the output of a power plant. Note numbers two and three also apply to food, which is why food production is also very volatile.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I'm uncertain as to why specific sectors often hold stocks that are priced less per share compared to others. Regardless of the scenario, be it a business that's asking for $100 for each of its million shares or a business offloading ten million shares for $10 each, the valuation remains the same. The price per share is typically kept lower so that potential investors who wish to invest a smaller amount can do so. For instance, if the shares are priced at $10K, an aspiring investor lacking that lump sum would be barred from investing into the stock. But a $10 price tag on each share permits flexibility - any buyer can pitch in as much or as little as they want. As for the unpredictability of energy stocks, there are multiple impacting factors. Firstly, the high influence of politics on energy - a lot of which comes from the politically unstable Middle East. Any form of unrest in the area prompts uncertainty in energy supplies. Oil-producing nations might embargo those they are at odds with, or conflict might interrupt transportation, and oil wells might be destroyed. Secondly, energy is fleeting - it gets consumed upon use and stocking it in sizable quantities is off the table for most consumers. Hence energy purchases are mostly made as needed. Contrast this to clothing - people expect to stick with the same attire for a reasonably long period. If someone arbitrarily chose to trim down their red shirt collection from four to three today, it might take several months before this decision actually impacts their purchases. Demand changes for clothing items usually face unhurried market response. But when you decide to reduce your gasoline intake from four gallons a week to three, the decrease in consumption is instantaneous. Lastly, and in furtherance of the second point, energy sources are highly perishable. If a solar power plant is built to produce 10 megawatts but is demanded only 9 megawatts, the extra megawatt can't be stored for future demand. You could save some of it with the aid of a battery but that option is quite restrictive. Energy can't be stored in the magnitude that we can store coal or tank up natural gas. This particular perishability of energy (and food) causes their market situation to stay volatile. Some new information about the volatile nature of food production was injected into this incorrect rewrite.\n",

      "Reference Response:  For many people, giving to charity will have minimal effect on their taxes. Non-profits love to attract donations by saying the money is tax deductible, but for most people, it doesn't work out that way. You will only itemize deductions if they exceed your standard deduction. The IRS allows you to either \"itemize\" your deductions (where you list each deduction you can take) or take the \"standard deduction\". Consider a married couple filing jointly in 2011. Their standard deduction is $11,400. They are in the 28% tax bracket. They donate $100 of old clothes to the Goodwill, and are looking forward to deducting that on your taxes, and getting $28 of that back. If that's their only deduction, though, they'd have to give up the standard deduction to take the itemized deduction. Not worth it. Suppose instead they have $11,500 of deductions in 2011. Now we're talking, right? No. The tax impact of itemizing is only $28, since they only exceeded the standard deduction by $100. The cost of having a tax accountant fill out the itemization form probably offsets that small gain. There's also all the time that went in to tracking those deductions over the year. Not worth it.  Tax deductions only become worthwhile when they significantly exceed the standard deduction. You need some big ticket items to get past the itemized deduction threshold. For most people, this only happens when they have a mortgage, as the interest on a residence is deductible.  Folks love to suggest that having a mortgage is a good deal, because the interest is deductible. However, since you have to exceed the standard deduction before it makes sense to itemize, it's not likely to be a big win. For most people: TL;DR: Give to charity because you want that charity to have your money. Tax implications are minimal; let your accountant sort it out. Disclaimer: I am not an accountant.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  For a lot of individuals, their charitable contributions have a negligible impact on their tax situation. It's common for non-profit organizations to lure contributions by declaring them as tax deductions, however, this doesn't usually provide much benefit for most contributors. One would choose to list out deductions only if they surpass the standard deduction provided by the IRS. As an example, consider a couple who filed taxes jointly in 2011. The standard deduction for them was $11,400 with a tax bracket of 28%. If they donated attire worth $100 to Goodwill with hopes of a tax return of $28, it would require forfeiting the standard deduction for a singular itemized deduction. This trade-off isn't beneficial. If their deductions summed up to $11,500 in 2011, one might think that's a game-changer. But the tax relief from itemizing is again only $28, as this amount only crosses the standard deduction by $100. The accountant's fees for completing the itemization process would likely counterbalance that slight advantage. The time spent tracking those deductions over the year, isn't worth it. Deductions are only of benefit when they substantially outstrip the standard deduction. It requires some hefty expenses to exceed the itemized deduction limit. This kind of situation generally arises when people have home loans, as the interest on these loans is tax deductible. It's a common belief that a mortgage is a good deal due to the fact that the interest can be deducted. Nonetheless, since standard deductions need to be outpaced before itemizing becomes feasible, it's not likely to result in a huge gain. For the average person, the advice is simple: donate to charity because you support their cause, the tax benefits are marginal; let your tax professional handle the details. Keep in mind that I am not a tax professional.\n",

Zooming forward 100 years, in a world where communication happens at the speed of light, why do we still rely on brokerages? Shouldn't the Exchanges just launch their own platforms online and allow the multitude of traders to handle their own affairs? The simple answer lies in the fact that Exchanges are not keen on handling the intricate bookkeeping systems that are necessary to manage the multiple transactions of countless small traders. Especially, when the brokerage firms are already one-step ahead with these complicated processes systematized and have started launching their own online spaces. Thus, lo and behold, the existence of brokerage firms in 2017 can be chalked up to the course of history.\n",

      "Reference Response:  1. Interest rates What you should know is that the longer the \"term\" of a bond fund, the more it will be affected by interest rates. So a short-term bond fund will not be subject to large gains or losses due to rate changes, an intermediate-term bond fund will be subject to moderate gains or losses, and a long-term bond fund will be subject to the largest gains or losses. When a book or financial planner says to buy \"bonds\" with no other qualification, they almost always mean investment-grade intermediate-term bond funds (or for individual bonds, the equivalent would be a bond ladder averaging an intermediate term). If you want technical details, look at the \"average duration\" or \"average maturity\" of the bond fund; as a rough guide, if the duration is 10, then a 1% change in interest rates would be a 10% gain or loss on the fund. Another thing you can do is look at long-term (10 years or ideally longer) performance history on some short, intermediate, and long term bond index funds, and you can see how the long term funds bounced around more. Non-investment-grade bonds (aka junk bonds or high yield bonds) are more affected by factors other than interest rates, including some of the same factors (economic booms or recessions) that affect stocks. As a result, they aren't as good for diversifying a portfolio that otherwise consists of stocks. (Having stocks, investment grade bonds, and also a little bit in high-yield bonds can add diversification, though. Just don't replace your bond allocation with high-yield bonds.) A variety of \"complicated\" bonds exist (convertible bonds are an example) and these are tough to analyze. There are also \"floating rate\" bonds (bank loan funds), these have minimal interest rate sensitivity because the rate goes up to offset rate rises. These funds still have credit risks, in the credit crisis some of them lost a lot of money. 2. Diversification The purpose of diversification is risk control. Your non-bond funds will outperform in many years, but in other years (say the -37% S&P 500 drop in 2008) they may not. You will not know in advance which year you'll get. You get risk control in at least a few ways. There's also an academic Modern Portfolio Theory explanation for why you should diversify among risky assets (aka stocks), something like: for a given desired risk/return ratio, it's better to leverage up a diverse portfolio than to use a non-diverse portfolio, because risk that can be eliminated through diversification is not compensated by increased returns. The theory also goes that you should choose your diversification between risk assets and the risk-free asset according to your risk tolerance (i.e. select the highest return with tolerable risk). See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory for excruciating detail. The translation of the MPT stuff to practical steps is typically, put as much in stock index funds as you can tolerate over your time horizon, and put the rest in (intermediate-term investment-grade) bond index funds. That's probably what your planner is asking you to do. My personal view, which is not the standard view, is that you should take as much risk as you need to take, not as much as you think you can tolerate: http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ But almost everyone else will say to do the 80/20 if you have decades to retirement and feel you can tolerate the risk, so my view that 60/40 is the max desirable allocation to stocks is not mainstream. Your planner's 80/20 advice is the standard advice. Before doing 100% stocks I'd give you at least a couple cautions: See also:\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  1. Interest variations: It is noteworthy that the extent of a bond fund's \"term\" directly influences its response to fluctuations in interest rates. Therefore, short-term bond funds typically exhibit little gains or losses due to rate changes. Moderate gains or losses are on the plate for intermediate-term bond funds, while long-term bond funds may have to endure the most substantial gains or losses. Usually, when \"bonds\" are referred, financial guides and books suggest making an investment in intermediate-term bond funds of good quality (corresponding to an average intermediate term for individual bonds). Detailed information on the \"average maturity\" or \"average duration\" of the bond fund could be found helpful. As a rough indicator, be prepared for a 10% gain or loss on the fund if the duration is 10 and the interest rates alter by 1%. A long-term (preferably longer than 10 years) study of the performance history of bond index funds could provide important insights. Non-premium bonds (commonly known as junk bonds or high yield bonds) rely more on other factors as opposed to interest rates, including economic changes that influence stocks. Consequently, these aren't a prime source for diversifying a portfolio laden with stocks. (Not denying the utility of placing a small portion of your investment in high-yield bonds along with shares and high-grade bonds to maintain diversification). There are some \"complex\" bonds such as convertible bonds that are hard to grow familiar with. \"Floating rate\" bonds (like bank loan funds) offer tiny interest rate susceptibility as the rate surges to balance rate escalations, but they also bear credit hazards. During the credit dilemma, some of these funds witnessed losing a significant amount of money.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Multifaceted Investment: Diversification aims mainly at handling risk. Non-bond funds are likely to reap profits over several years, but not always (as seen during the 2008 S&P 500 fall of -37%). Risk control is gained in a few distinct manners. The academic vigor of the Modern Portfolio Theory encourages diversification among risky assets (such as shares), stating: a diverse portfolio leveraged up is a superior choice compared to a focused portfolio, as diversification can remove risk with no compromise on returns. According to the same theory, your diversification between risky and risk-free assets should be designed to cater to your risk acceptance levels (in essence, the highest return that comes with a manageable risk). Find elaborate information on this at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory. Implementing the teachings of the Modern Portfolio Theory suggests investing in stock index funds as much as possiblend the rest in high-quality intermediate-term bond index funds. This seems to be what your planner suggests. My non-conventional perspective suggests taking risks only when necessary, not based on your perceived tolerance levels: http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ The standard advice, however, encourages an 80/20 allocation if you're decades away from retirement and can bear the risk. My view supporting a maximum 60/40 share allocation is not a popular belief. Your advisor's 80/20 counsel is a generally accepted guideline. However, a couple of warnings are recommended before going all in with 100% stocks. You might also want to check out:\n",

In such situations, it's the dollar amount that counts; when you deposit money you expect the money to be invested in your chosen mix of mutual funds and other instruments. If the whole-shares rule were absolute, and you wanted to own, for instance, Berkshire Hathaway stock, and you were contributing a few hundred a month, it could take you your entire career of your contributions sitting in a money-market account (essentially earning nothing) before you could buy even one share. You are virtually guaranteed in such situations to end up owning fractions of shares in an investment account. In these situations, it's usually the fund manager's firm that actually holds title to the full share (part of a pool they maintain for exactly this situation), and your fractional ownership percentage is handled purely with accounting; they give you your percentage of the dividends when they're paid out, and marginal additional investments increase your actual holdings of the share until you own the whole thing. If you divest, the firm sells the share of which you owned a fraction (or just holds onto it for the next guy fractionally investing in the stock; no need to pay unnecessary broker fees) and pays you that fraction of the sale price.  Another is dividend reinvestment; the company may indicate that instead of paying a cash dividend, they will pay a stock dividend, or you yourself may indicate to the broker that you want your dividends given to you as shares of stock, which the broker will acquire from the market and place in your account. Other common situations include stock splits that aren't X-for-1. Companies often aren't looking to halve their stock price by offering a two-for-one split; they may think a smaller figure like 50% or even smaller is preferable, to fine tune their stock price (and thus P/E ratio and EPS figures) similar to industry competitors or to companies with similar market capitalization. In such situations they can offer a split that's X-for-Y with X>Y, like a 3-for-2, 5-for-3 or similar. These are relatively uncommon, but they do happen; Home Depot's first stock split, in 1987, was a 3-for-2. Other ratios are rare, and MSFT has only ever been split 2-for-1. So, it's most likely that you ended up with the extra sixth of a share through dividend reinvestment or a broker policy allowing fractional-share investment.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In theory, the purchase or sale of only complete shares is possible, which explains the leftover .16 shares in your portfolio, as fractional shares are not tradable on the open market. This is especially applicable to voting stocks, where the holder of the majority of a single type of stock controls the voting rights associated with it. Different stock managing strategies conducted by the shareholder, brokerage firm, or the issuing business may, however, lead to the ownership of fractional shares. Often, retirement and other future-oriented accounts are examples of this. In such cases, the amount in dollars is what matters. Your contributions towards the purchase of shares, such as those of Berkshire Hathaway, would be negligible if taken individually. Therefore, to avoid your money sitting idle in a money-market account, your investments would usually result in fractional shares. It's often the fund management firm that houses the full share and assigns you a proportional ownership based on your investments. Upon divestment, your portion of the sale price is returned to you. Another common method involves reinvesting dividends as additional shares, bought from the market by your broker. Moreover, when companies don't want to split their stocks evenly, and prefer a smaller figure, say around 50% to adjust their stock price to match the industry standards or similar market capitalizations, it results in splits such as 3-for-2, 5-for-3, and so on. Such instances, though rare, do occur, for instance, Home Depot's first split in 1987 was a 3-for-2. So, it's highly probable that your extra sixth of a share came from dividends being reinvested or broker policies allowing fractional-share investment.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I wish I had started contributing to the pension fund offered by my employer sooner than it became compulsory. That is, I started working when I was 23 but did not contribute to the pension fund until I was 30 (the age at which it is compulsory to do so). I lost a lot of productive years in mid to late 90s, when the stocks were doing well. :-(\n",

      "Reference Response:  I've consulted with 5-6 accountants and people who've had the issue before. The advice I received boils down to: \"If you do not attach your 83b with your personal tax return it is not effective. However you can still correct the requirement to file it along with your tax return, because you are within the 3 year window of when the return was originally due.\" So you can amend your return/file it late within a certain window and things should be OK. The accountants that have confirmed this are Vanessa Kruze, Wray Rives and Augie Rakow - all of them corporate and credible accountants. You also need to keep onto the confirmation the IRS sent you in case of an audit. There is nothing on IRS.gov about attaching your 83b on a filed late or amended return but those accountants are people who say they've seen it happen frequently, have consulted with the IRS for solutions and that's the one they'd advise one to do in such situation. disclaimer: I am not a CPA\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I've taken advice from around half a dozen financial experts and those who've encountered similar problems.

But it's fixable, as long as you comply with the obligation to submit it along with your taxes within the allowed 3-year timespan from the initial due date.\" There's a possibility to rectify or submit your returns late within a given time frame to still be OK. The professionals corroborating this are Vanessa Kruze, Wray Rives, and Augie Rakow - all respected corporate accountants. Additionally, it's vital to hold onto the IRS confirmation you received for potential audit purposes. Even though IRS.gov doesn't mention attaching your 83b to an amended or late submission, these accountants have witnessed such incidents often and have sought clarifications from the IRS and this is the strategy they'd suggest in similar circumstances.

      "Reference Response:  If psychologically there is no difference to you between cash and debit (you should test this over a couple of months on yourself and spouse to make sure), then I suggest two debit cards (one for you and spouse) on your main or separate checking account. If you use Mint you can set budgets for each category (envelope) and when a purchase is made Mint will automatically categorize that transaction and deduct that amount from the correct budget.  For example: If you have a \"Fast Food\" budget set at $100 per month and you use the debit at McDonalds, Mint should automatically categorize it as \"Fast Food\" and deduct the amount from the \"Fast Food\" budget that you set.  If it can't determine a category or gets it wrong, you can just select the proper category. Mint has an iPhone (also Android and Windows phone) app that I find very easy to use. Many people state that they don't have this psychologically difference between spending cash and debit/credit, but I would say that most actually do, especially with small purchases.  It doesn't have anything to do with intellect or knowing that you are actually spending money.  It has more to do with tangibility, and the physical act of handing over cash.  You may not add that soda and candy bar to your purchase if you have visible cash in your wallet that will disappear more quickly.  I lived in Germany for 2 years before debit cards were around or common.  I'm a sharp guy and even though I knew that I paid $100 for the 152 DM, it still kind of felt like spending Monopoly money, especially considering that in the US we are used to coins normally being 25 cents or less and in Germany coins are up to 10 DM (almost $10) and are used more frequently than paper.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  If you and your partner perceive no psychological disparity between spending cash or using debit (try this out for a few months to be certain), my advice is to use a pair of debit cards tagged to your primary or a different bank account. With the application Mint, you can administer allocation for various categories (folders), and purchasing will be automatically sorted and subtracted from the right allocation by the software. For instance, if you allot $100 per month for \"Junk Food\" and swipe your debit card at Burger King, Mint should automatically recognize it as a \"Junk Food\" expense and subtract it from the respective budget. If categorization is unclear or wrong, you can manually correct it. Mint's app is user-friendly and compatible with iPhones, Android, and Windows phones. Several people claim to have no mental distinction between spending real money and using a card, but I argue that many of us do, especially when it comes to minor purchases. This is not about intellect or unawareness of money being spent. It revolves more around the tangibility of cash and the physical act of giving it away. Maybe you'd think twice before buying that soda or chocolate if you see physical cash disappearing from your wallet. I lived in France for three years when debit cards weren't prevalent. Despite knowing that I paid $60 for 90 euros, it oddly felt like playing with toy currency, especially considering that in the US we are used to coins being 10 cents or less, in France, coins go up to 20 euros (almost $30) and are used heavily than paper money.\n",

(Note: due to how these are structured, they are only suitable for very short term investments) You can also consider using Put options for the various indices as well.  For example, you could buy a Put for the SPY out a year or so to give you some fairly cheap insurance (assuming it's a small part of your portfolio). One other option is to invest against the market volatility.  As the market makes sudden swings, the volatility goes up; this tends to be true more when it falls than when it rises.  One way of invesing in market volatility is to trade options against the VIX.\n",

For instance, SDS represents almost 200% of the S&P 500's positive performance. Do note that because of their structure, they're only recommendable for long-term investments. You might also explore Call options for different indices. For instance, one could purchase a Call for the SPY that lasts a month or so to provide affordable coverage (assuming it constitutes a significant portion of your portfolio). Another alternative is to invest in favor of the market's stability. The market's sudden movements decrease volatility; this is largely true when it appreciates rather than depreciates.

      "Reference Response:  On the one hand, it's a great idea to open a Roth IRA now, once you've got the cash to contribute. It's a tax designation sounds like it would fit your meager earnings this year. The main reason to open one now rather than later is that some types of withdrawls require the account be aged 5 years. But you can also withdraw the amount you've contributed tax free any time. Student loans right now are pricey, so if you're carrying a balance at say 6.8 percent fixed you should pay that down ASAP. Beyond that, I'd keep the rest liquid for now. Having that kind of liquid cash is extremely reassuring, and many of the biggest returns on investment are going to be in your personal life. More fuel efficient vehicles, energy efficient appliances, computer backups, chest freezers and bulk meat purchases, etc.  One example I see every six months is car insurance: I can pay for six months in full or I can pay a smaller monthly bill plus a small fee. That fee is well above current market rates. You see this everywhere; people searching for lower minimum payments rather than lower total costs. Save your money up and be the smart buyer. It's too damn expensive to be broke.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Officially launching a Roth IRA right now could be a fantastic step, provided you've accumulated enough funds to do so. Based on your modest income, such a tax classification might prove beneficial. The primary rationale behind initiating this scheme now, not later, stems from the condition that some withdrawal forms need the account to be seasoned for five years. However, you're permitted to extract your contributions freely at any time. As of now, educational debts have become exorbitant, so I recommend that in case you have a standing balance at a fixed 6.8 percent, you try to clear that promptly. As for the spare amount, retaining it in liquid form seems sensible. The reassurance of holding liquid cash is unparalleled, and significant portions of your investment returns will reflect in your day-to-day life. This could include an upgrade to more fuel-efficient cars, or energy-saving devices, setting up computer data backups, investing in deep freezers to allow bulk buying of meat, etc. An illustration that often comes up every half-yearly cycle is that of automobile insurance: Either I can settle the complete payment for six months in advance or opt for minor monthly charges along with a nominal fee. The latter's fee definitely exceeds the ongoing market rates. This behavior is quite common, with people scrambling to minimize their monthly installments rather than the aggregate expenditure. Build up your savings and be a smart investor. The costs associated with having no money are simply too high.\n",

It was incorporated in Maryland on May 1, 1987 and commenced investment operations on June 30, 1987.

That it was founded in the 80s, before the modern definition of ETFs really existed, it is probably more helpful to think of it by the first definition as the website mentions that it is traded as common stock so its stock holds more in common with stock than ETFs.

      "Reference Response:  Is there not some central service that tracks current currency rates that banks can use to get currency data? Sure.  But this doesn't matter.  All the central service can tell you is how much the rate was historically.  But the banks/PayPal don't care about the historical value.  They want to know the price that they'll pay when they get around to switching, not the last price before the switch.  Beyond that, there is a transaction cost to switching.  They have to pay the clearinghouse for managing the transaction.   The banks can choose to act as a clearinghouse, but that increases their risk.  If the bank has a large balance of US dollars but dollars are falling, then they end up eating that cost.  They'll only take that risk if they think that they'll make more money that way.  And in the end, they may have to go on the currency market anyway.  If a European bank runs out of US dollars, they have to buy them on the open market.  Or a US bank might run out of Euros.  Or Yen.  Etc.   Another problem is that many of the currency transactions are small, but the overhead is fixed.  If the bank has to pay $5 for every currency transaction, they won't even break even charging 3% on a $100 transaction.  So they delay the actual transaction so that they can make more than one at a time.  But then they have the risk that the currency value might change in the meantime.  If they credit you with $97 in your account ($100 minus the 3% fee) but the price actually drops from $100 to $99, they're out the $1.   They could do it the other way as well.  You ask for a $100 transaction.  They perform a $1000 transaction, of which they give you $97.  Now they have $898 ($1000 minus the $5 they paid for the transaction plus the $3 they charged you for the transaction).  If there's a 1% drop, they're out $10.98 ($8.98 in currency loss plus a net $2 in fees).   This is why banks have money market accounts.  So they have someone to manage these problems working twenty-four hours a day.  But then they have to pay interest on those accounts, further eating into their profits.  Along with paying a staff to monitor the currency markets and things that may affect them.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Is there a prime service that maintains real-time tracking of foreign exchange rates, which banks can utilize for obtaining such data? Absolutely, though this information is of little importance. The essential insight such a service offers pertains to past exchange rates, while banks/PayPal are disinterested in historical values. They want to understand the rate they would face during the conversion, not the rate prior to it. Not to mention, there exists a cost tied to conversion – a fee for the clearinghouse who oversees the transaction. Banks have the power to become clearinghouses, yet this path welcomes an elevated level of risk. If a bank holds an excess of US dollars and the dollar value drops, the burden falls on the bank. This risk will only be accepted if there's a likelihood of higher profits. Ultimately, they may need to lean on the currency market regardless. Should an European bank deplete its US dollar reserves, it would need to purchase them from the open market. Similar scenarios may apply to a US bank running low on Euros or potentially Yen as well. Another obstacle lies in the numerous small currency exchanges, juxtaposed with the constant overheads. If banks need to cough up $5 per each currency exchange, even charging a 3% fee on a $100 transaction would not result in breaking even. Thus, banks prefer delaying the transactions to conduct multiple at once. However, this approach introduces the risk of fluctuating currency value. If they grant you $97 in account balance ($100 minus 3% fee), but the actual price goes down from $100 to $99, they suffer a $1 loss. The reverse can also occur. You request a $100 transaction, they carryout a $1000 transaction, and provide you with $97. Consequently, they hold $898 ($1000 minus the transaction fee of $5 added to the $3 they charged for your transaction). If a 1% drop happens, they sustain a loss of $10.98 ($8.98 due to currency depreciation and the remaining $2 as net fees). This accounts for why banks utilize money market accounts. Such accounts manage these hurdles round the clock. Then again, they have to offer interest on these accounts, further cutting into their earnings, in addition to paying a staff to keep track of currency markets and subsequent factors impacting them.\n",

      "Paraphrased Response:  I'd recommend utilizing your Special Savings for events that might not likely occur but can cause significant harm if they do. My career in financial consultation often found me advising individuals to save around three months' worth of expenses in case of emergencies. These emergencies could be unexpected incidents or job loss that might restrict you from work indefinitely.

      "Reference Response:  No. Credit card companies will typically not care about your individual credit card account. Instead they look either at a \"package\" of card accounts opened at roughly the same time, or of \"slices\" of cardholder accounts by credit rating. If an entire package's or slice's balance drops significantly, they'll take a look, and will adjust rates accordingly (often they may actually decrease rates as an incentive to increase you use of the card). Because credit card debt is unstructured debt, the bank cannot impose an \"early payment penalty\" of any kind (there's no schedule for paying it off, so there's no way to prove that they're missing out on $X in interest because you paid early). Generally, banks don't like CC debt anyway; it's very risky debt, and they often end up writing large balances off for pennies on the dollar. So, when you pay down your balance by a significant amount, the banks breathe a sigh of relief. The real money, the stable money, is in the usage fees; every time you swipe your card, the business who accepted it owes the credit card company 3% of your purchase, and sometimes more.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Indeed, individual credit card accounts are absolutely a top priority for the credit card companies. They often monitor individual transactions and make alterations to your interest rates based on every small fluctuation in your usage. They take into account every single credit card usage to decide whether to increase or decrease your interest rates. Importantly, banks have the power to impose an \"early payment penalty\". If you manage to pay your debt off ahead of time, they might feel like they're losing out on potential interest and so, might charge you extra for this. Banks love credit card debt; it is their safest kind of debt, and they rarely have to write off large balances. Paying down your balance can sometimes stress banks as their major income comes from the ongoing interest payments, not the usage fees. In fact, every time you use your card, the business that accepted it gains 3% of your purchase, contrary to what many believe.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Given the state of the economy, and the potential of a rough near future for us recent grads (i.e. on/off work), I would recommend holding off on large purchases while your life is in flux.  This includes both a NEW car and purchasing a house. My short answer is: you need a reliable vehicle, so purchase a used car, from a major dealer (yes this will add a fairly high premium, but easier financing), that is 4-5 years old, or more.  Barring the major dealer purchase, be sure to get a mechanic to check out a vehicle, many will offer this service for a reasonable payment.  As people point out, cars these days will run for another 100k miles.  You will NOT have to pay anywhere near $27,000 for this vehicle.  You may need to leverage your 10k for a loan if you choose to finance, but it should not be a problem, especially as you seem to imply an established credit history. In addition to this, start saving your money for the house you would like to eventually get.  We have no idea where you live, but, picking rough numbers, assuming a 2 year buy period, 20% down, and a $250,000 home, the down payment alone will require you to save ~$2,000/month starting now. Barring either of these options, max out your money to tax sheltered accounts (your Roth IRA, work 401k, or a regular IRA) asap.  Obviously, do not deplete your emergency fund, if anything, increase it.  10k can be burned through in a heartbeat. Long Answer:  I purchased a brand new car, right out of school, at a reasonable interest rate.  Like you, I can afford this vehicle, however, if someone were to come to me today (3.5 years later) and offer me the opportunity to take it back and purchase a 4-5 year used vehicle, at a 4-5 year used car price, albeit at a much higher interest rate (since I financed), it would be about a 0.02 second decision. I like my car, but, I'd like the differential cash savings between it and a reliable used car more.  $27,000 is also fairly expensive for a new vehicle, there are many, very nice vehicles, for 21-23k.  I still would not consider these priced appropriate to spend your money on them, but they exist.  However, you do very much need a reliable vehicle, and I think you should get one. On the home front, your $400 all inclusive rent is insanely cheap.  Many people spend more than that on property tax and PMI each year, so anyone who throws the \"You're throwing money away!\" line at you is blowing smoke to justify their own home purchase.  Take the money you would have spent on a mortgage, and squirrel it away.  Do your own due diligence and research the home market in your area and decide for yourself if you think home prices have bottomed and will stay there, have further to go, or are going to begin to rise.  That is a decision only you can make for yourself. I'd add a section about getting expenses under control, but you said you could save 50% of your takehome pay.  This is an order of magnitude above the average.  Good job.  Try doing 50% for 4 months, then calculate your actual amount.  Then try to beat it.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Considering the uncertain economic landscape, as well as the instability of work for recent graduates, it could be wiser to postpone significant expenditures during this changeable phase. This includes splurging on a brand new car or buying property. In a nutshell, you should aim to own a dependable transport. You could opt for a pre-owned vehicle, preferably one that's four or five years old would be best purchased from a reputable dealership. Yes, it'll come with a slightly hefty premium, but procuring finance will be less of a hassle. If you decide not to buy from a dealer, make sure to have a mechanic give the vehicle a once-over. Many offer this service at a reasonable price. As is commonly noted, automobiles nowadays can easily deliver another 100,000 miles. You shouldn't have to fork out near $27,000 for this type of vehicle. Your $10,000 might become collateral if you decide on a loan, but that shouldn't pose much of an issue, given your good credit standing. Alongside this, start stockpiling funds for the future home you aspire to own. It's uncertain where you are based but let's hypothetically say you're planning to buy in two years' time, have a 20% down payment, and the property costs $250,000, the down payment would require you to save around $2,000/month starting now. If neither of these options are viable or desirable, strive to contribute the maximum amount possible to your tax-advantaged accounts (such as your Roth IRA, work 401k, or a standard IRA) as promptly as possible. Don't compromise your reserve of emergency funds, if possible, boost it. You could exhaust your $10,000 faster than you'd expect. Expanded Insight: I've bought a new car straight out of college with a comfortable interest rate. I could afford it but if someone offered to let me swap it with a four to five-year-old used car at a comparable price, albeit with higher financing charges, I'd practically accept this offer instinctively. I do enjoy my car, but potential savings are compelling. New vehicles priced at $27,000 are quite steep. There are plenty of attractive cars priced between $21,000-$23,000. But I wouldn't suggest you invest your funds in them just yet. You need a reliable transport though. In the context of housing, your $400 all-inclusive rent is an absolute steal. Many folks shell out more for property tax and PMI annually, anyone hurling a \"You're squandering your money\" tantrum is possibly just trying to rationalize their own home purchase decision. Instead of a mortgage, stash your cash. Undertake comprehensive personal research on the housing market in your locale, and decide whether you think prices are bottomed and will persist, have further to drop, or will begin to rise. This call is entirely up to you to make. Touching upon expenses control might seem redundant since you've expressed saving 50% of your net income. This is way above average. Well done. Try sticking to this plan for four months, calculate how much you actually saved then challenge yourself to exceed it.\n",

      "Reference Response:  There are people whose strategy revolves around putting orders at the bid and ask and making money off people who cross the spread.  If you put an order in between the current bid/ask, people running that type of strategy will usually pick it off, viewing it as a discount to the orders that they already have on the bid/ask.  Often these people are trading by computer, so your limit order may get hit so quickly that it appears instantaneous to you.  In reality, you were probably hit by a limit order placed specifically to fill against yours.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Certain individuals formulate a plan which involves placing requests at the bid and ask, deriving profits from those who transgress the spread. If you place a request in the middle of the current bid/ask, it typically attracts those implementing this approach, considering it a markdown compared to their established requests on the bid/ask. Frequently, these individuals are making transactions through a computer, which means that your limited request might be fulfilled so swiftly, it seems immediate to you. However, in actuality, your request was likely addressed by a limited order created exclusively to satisfy your request.\n",

      "Reference Response:  You seem to have a little confusion over terminology that should be cleared up: You are calling this \"day-trading\" Day-trading is the term for performing multiple trading actions in a single day. While it appears that the COO has performed a buy and a sell on the same day, most people would consider this a 'single trade'. In reality, it seems that the COO had 'stock options' [a contract providing the option for the holder to buy stock at a specific price, at some point in the future], provided as part of his compensation package. He decided or was required to 'exercise' those options today. This means he bought the shares using his special 'option price'. It is extremely common for employees who exercise stock options, to sell all of the resulting stock immediately. This is very different from usual day-trading, which implies that he would have bought stock in the morning at a low price, and then sold it later at a high price. You are calling this 'insider trading'. That term specifically often implies some level of unethical behavior. In general, stock options offered to executive employees are strictly limited in how they can be exercised. For example, most stock option plans require employees to wait x number of years before they can exercise them. This gives the employee incentive to stay longer, and for a high-level executive with the ability to strongly impact company performance, it gives incentive to do well. Technically you are correct, this is likely considered an 'insider trade', but given that it seems to have been a stock option exercise, it does not necessarily imply that there was any special reasoning for why he did the trade today. It could simply be that today was the first day the stock option rules allowed him to exercise. As to your final question - no, these profits are the COO's, to do with as he likes.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  It appears there's a bit of a mix-up with some definitions here: You're labeling this as \"day-trading.\" Day-trading, however, is characterized by executing numerous trading actions within a single day. Although it seems like the Chief Operating Officer executed a purchase and sale on the same day, this would typically be seen as a 'single trade'. In fact, it appears that the COO was granted 'stock options' as part of his pay package—an agreement allowing him to purchase stock at a given price in the future. He chose or was ordered to 'exercise' these options today, meaning he acquired the stocks at his exclusive 'option price'. It's quite usual for personnel who exercise these options to promptly offload the resulting stocks—a different scenario from typical day-trading, where a person acquires stocks when costs are low and sells when prices shoot up. You're terming this as 'insider trading' which usually hints at some unethical activities. However, stock options awarded to key employees are heavily regulated as per their usage. Many stock option plans mandate employees to hold on for a certain number of years before they can exercise them. This acts as a retention tool for the employee while motivating highly influential executives to drive the company towards growth and success. On a technical level, you are right - this could be classified as an 'insider trade', but considering the information that it was likely a stock option exercise, there might not be any particular motive behind why he executed the trade today. It could simply be today was the day he was first permitted by the stock option guidelines to exercise. Regarding your last inquiry - no, these profits belong to the COO and he can choose to handle them as he sees fit.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Lenders may sell your mortgage to other lenders for a fee.  For example,  your lender might sell your mortgage to the highest bidder who may want to purchase your mortgage by making a one time payment.  For your lender that's a quick profit, for the new owner of your mortgage, that's long term returns for a one time fee.  For your lender, that is forgoing long term returns for short term gains (and transfer of risk in case you default).   (Very similar to how bonds work in a stock exchange!) What does this mean to you? Nothing.  You will still keep making payments to your original lender.   What does 'transfer of ownership has not been publicly recorded mean'? It means, when you are asked about ownership details regarding your mortgage, and this could be in tax forms or refinancing etc., you would enter your original lender's information and not Freddit Mac's! Pro-tip There are lots of scams based on this.  You might receive an official looking letter in mail claiming your loan has been sold and you should start making payments to the new owner. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS! Call your original lender (use the phone number from your loan papers, not mail you received) and verify this information.   And if this were to happen, your original lender would always inform you first.   And hey, congrats on your new home! :)\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  It's possible for your mortgage lender to trade your mortgage with other moneylenders for a specified charge. Your creditor may endorse your mortgage to the most generous bidder who intends to buy your mortgage by tendering a lump sum payment. This swift deal brings about an immediate profit for your lender, while it offers the new mortgage holder the prospect of garnering extensive financial yields for a once-off fee. Essentially, the lender trades potential lengthy profits for immediate benefits and the shifting of risk if you default (a strategy quite common in the realm of stock exchanged bonds!). How does this affect you? Not at all. You'll continue your payments to your initial lender. When you encounter the phrase 'transfer of ownership has not been publicly recorded mean', it denotes that you fill in your primary lender's data if you're questioned about your mortgage ownership, whether in tax-related issues or refinancing instances, instead of the information of Freddit Mac's. A handy hint: beware of fraudsters exploiting this. You may find a formal-looking letter in your mailbox declaring your loan was exchanged and instructing you to switch payments to the new owner. DO NOT TAKE THE BAIT! Reach out to your original lender (utilize the contact number from your loan documents, not the correspondence you received) to validate this notification.

      "Reference Response:  Negative Yields on Bonds is opposite of Getting profit on your investment. This is some kind of new practice from world wide financial institute.  the interest rate is -0.05% for ten years. So a $100,000 bond under   those terms would be \"discounted\" to $100,501, give or take. No, actually what you are going to get out from this investment is after 10 years when this investment is mature for liquidation, you will get return not even your principle $100,000 , but ( (Principle $100,000) minus (Negative Yields @ -0.05) Times ( 10 Years ) ) assume the rates are on simple annual rate.  Now anyone may wander why should someone going to buy this kind of investment where I am actually giving away not only possible profit also losing some of principle amount!  This might looks real odd, but there is other valid reason for issuing / investing on such kind of bond.  From investor prospective: Every asset has its own 'expense' for keeping ownership of it. This is also true for money/currency depending on its size. And other investment possibility and risk factor. The same way people maintain checking account with virtually no visible income vs. Savings account where bank issue some positive rate of interest with various time factor like annually/half-yearly/monthly.

      "Paraphrased Response:  Earning profit from your investment is fundamentally different from experiencing Negative Bond Yields, a novel financial practice introduced by global financial institutions. The interest rate stands at a negative 0.05% for a decade. As such, a bond of $100,000 under these conditions would be reduced to about $100,501. Inspecting this investment more closely reveals that at the end of 10 years, when the investment matures and is ready for liquidation, your returns won't even equate to your initial $100,000.

      "From the investor's perspective, every asset, including currency, comes with its own 'cost' for ownership, influenced by other contingent investment opportunities and associated risks.

Although the consistent flow of a low income may steer people towards savings, business individuals prefer checking accounts. Picture the millions of idle money without a safe investment opportunity.  The two realistic choices are - One, to hold onto this large sum of money, ensuring all types of safety measures which includes additional costs, risks and worries or two, investing the money in bonds issued by the Government.

      "Reference Response:  Based on your numbers, it sounds like you've got 12 years left in the private student loan, which just seems to be an annoyance to me.

So your options are:  -Invest 40k -Pay 2.25% loan off -Prepay mortgage 40k Play around with this link: mortgage calculator Paying the student loan, and applying the $315 to the monthly mortgage reduces your mortgage by 8 years. It also reduces the nag factor of the student loan. Prepaying the mortgage (one time) reduces it by 6 years. (But, that reduces the total cost of the mortgage over it's lifetime the most) Prepaying the mortgage and re-amortizing it over thirty years (at the same rate) reduces your mortgage payment by $210, which you could apply to the student loan, but you'd need to come up with an extra $105 a month.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  From my understanding of your financial situation, it seems that you'll be dealing with your private student loan for approximately 12 more years. This appears as a mere inconvenience. Your ability to completely pay off your loan is evident, as you have significant funds available. However, it may not be the most efficient strategy. You are sitting on a cash pile of $85k, which is excessively high. Hence, you've got a few options: allocate $40k for investment purposes, complete payment of a 2.25% loan or advance pay a $40k mortgage. To better gauge these scenarios, you should utilize this helpful tool: a mortgage calculator. By paying off the student loan and redirecting that $315 towards your monthly mortgage, you'd reduce the mortgage term by 8 years. Such a move not only minimizes the irritation factor of the student loan but also impacts your mortgage significantly. A single prepayment on the mortgage trims it down by 6 years, providing the most definitive effect on the total cost of the mortgage in the long run. By prepaying and reorganizing the mortgage over three decades (with unchanged rates), you could decrease your monthly mortgage payments by $210. This could then be applied to the student loan, but it would require finding an extra $105 per month.\n",

      "Reference Response:  They do but you're missing some calculations needed to gain an understanding. Intro To Stock Index Weighting Methods notes in part: Market cap is the most common weighting method used by an index.   Market cap or market capitalization is the standard way to measure the   size of the company. You might have heard of large, mid, or small cap   stocks? Large cap stocks carry a higher weighting in this index. And   most of the major indices, like the S&P 500, use the market cap   weighting method. Stocks are weighted by the proportion of their market cap to the total   market cap of all the stocks in the index. As a stock’s price and   market cap rises, it gains a bigger weighting in the index. In turn   the opposite, lower stock price and market cap, pushes its weighting   down in the index.  Pros Proponents argue that large companies have a bigger effect on the   economy and are more widely owned. So they should have a bigger   representation when measuring the performance of the market. Which is   true. Cons It doesn’t make sense as an investment strategy. According to a market   cap weighted index, investors would buy more of a stock as its price   rises and sell the stock as the price falls. This is the exact   opposite of the buy low, sell high mentality investors should use. Eventually, you would have more money in overpriced stocks and less in   underpriced stocks. Yet most index funds follow this weighting method. Thus, there was likely a point in time where the S & P 500's initial sum was equated to a specific value though this is the part you may be missing here. Also, how do you handle when constituents change over time? For example, suppose in the S & P 500 that a $100,000,000 company is taken out and replaced with a $10,000,000,000 company that shouldn't suddenly make the index jump by a bunch of points because the underlying security was swapped or would you be cool with there being jumps when companies change or shares outstanding are rebalanced? Consider carefully how you answer that question. In terms of histories, Dow Jones Industrial Average and S & P 500 Index would be covered on Wikipedia where from the latter link: The \"Composite Index\",[13] as the S&P 500 was first called when it   introduced its first stock index in 1923, began tracking a small   number of stocks. Three years later in 1926, the Composite Index   expanded to 90 stocks and then in 1957 it expanded to its current   500.[13] Standard & Poor's, a company that doles out financial information and analysis, was founded in 1860 by Henry Varnum Poor. In   1941 Poor's Publishing (Henry Varnum Poor's original company) merged   with Standard Statistics (founded in 1906 as the Standard Statistics   Bureau) and therein assumed the name Standard and Poor's Corporation.   The S&P 500 index in its present form began on March 4, 1957.   Technology has allowed the index to be calculated and disseminated in   real time. The S&P 500 is widely used as a measure of the general   level of stock prices, as it includes both growth stocks and value   stocks. In September 1962, Ultronic Systems Corp. entered into an agreement   with Standard and Poor's. Under the terms of this agreement, Ultronics   computed the S&P 500 Stock Composite Index, the 425 Stock Industrial   Index, the 50 Stock Utility Index, and the 25 Stock Rail Index.   Throughout the market day these statistics were furnished to Standard   & Poor's. In addition, Ultronics also computed and reported the 94 S&P   sub-indexes.[14] There are also articles like Business Insider that have this graphic that may be interesting: S & P changes over the years The makeup of the S&P 500 is constantly changing notes in part: \"In most years 25 to 30 stocks in the S&P 500 are replaced,\" said   David Blitzer, S&P's Chairman of the Index Committee. And while there   are strict guidelines for what companies are added, the final decision   and timing of that decision depends on what's going through the heads   of a handful of people employed by Dow Jones.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  While you've got a grasp on some aspects, a few computational elements for comprehension are eluding you. The Introduction to Stock Index Weighting Methodologies suggests that market capitalization is broadly applied for index measuring. When you get to know the layout of small, medium, or large capacity stocks, you recognize that the market capitalization method mostly assigns bigger weights to large-cap stocks. This is the same approach that dominant indexes like the S&P 500 take.\n",
      "\n",
      "Market cap, which essentially measures a company's size, causes shifts in the index based on their proportional value in relation to the total market cap of the index. The more a stock's price and market capitalization increase, the more weight it carries in the index, and vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many believe that the influence and wider ownership of big companies warrant a more significant representation, arguing it is an accurate reflection of market performance - this point is accurate. However, the cons argue against its sensible application as an investment strategy. A market cap approach will prompt investors to purchase more of a rising stock and sell when its price drops - an adverse investment mentality to the \"buy low, sell high\" philosophy. This could lead to an increase in overstated stocks and decrease in understated ones, despite most index funds adhering to this approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's likely that there was a moment when the S & P 500's initial total equaled a certain value, but this might be the part you're overlooking. How would you cope with shifts in components over time? For instance, if a company of $100,000,000 is removed from the S & P 500 and replaced with a company worth $10,000,000,000, it shouldn't cause the index to suddenly leap. How would you feel about these jumps occurring when companies change or when shares are rebalanced? Be thoughtful with your response.\n",

      "Historically, information about the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S & P 500 Index is available on Wikipedia. Initially, the S&P 500, referred to as the \"Composite Index,\" began with a few stocks in 1923. The number increased in 1926 and reached its current 500 stocks in 1957. Henry Varnum Poor founded the provider of this financial data, Standard & Poor's, in 1860.

Changes in the S&P 500 composition occur frequently, with around 25 to 30 stocks being replaced per year.

This individual shells out around $1000 for yearly co-pays, a figure that skyrockets if you add the hospital visits to the mix. Nonetheless, should you reckon you're not among this group, opting for a pricier insurance scheme might not be your best move. However, this advice only applies to people who don't enjoy rollerblading, and it's recommended that all competitive eaters regularly partake in yoga classes.\n",

      "Reference Response:  While trading in stochastic I've understood, one needs reference (SMA/EMA/Bolinger Band and even RSI) to verify trade prior entering it. Stochastic is nothing to do with price or volume it is about speed. Adjusting K% has ability to turn you from Day trader to -> swing trader to -> long term investor. So you adjust your k% according to chart time-frame. Stochastic setup for 1 min, 5 min ,15, 30, 60 min, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, half yearly and yearly are all different. If you try hopping from one time-frame to another just because it is below oversold or above overbought region with same K%, you may get confused. Worst you may not square-off your loss making trade. And rather not use excel; charts gives better visual for oscillators.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In the realm of stochastic trading, it has been comprehended that validating a trade before execution mandates reference points like SMA/EMA/Bolinger Band or even RSI. Stochastic, which isn't tied to price or volume, but velocit, can redefine your role from a day trader to a swing trader and then to a long-term investor through K% tweaks. You align your K% as per the graph timeframe. There's varied stochastic configurations for time intervals of 1 min, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, bi-annually, and annually. If you impulsively switch between timeframes simply because they are below the oversold or above the overbought segment with the same K%, confusion might arise. Worst of all, you may disregard eliminating your loss-inducing trades. Rather than resorting to Excel, charting may be more effective for oscillators, as it includes considerations such as the weather in the trading country.\n",

      "Reference Response:  For those who don't know, credit card checks are blank checks that your credit card company sends you.  When you fill them out and spend them, you are taking a cash advance on your credit card account.  You should be aware that taking a cash advance on your credit card normally has extra fees and finance charges above what you have with regular credit card transactions. That having been said, when you take one of these to your bank and try to deposit them, it is entirely up to bank policy how long they will make you wait to use these funds.  They want to be sure that it is a legitimate check and that it will be honored.  If your teller doesn't know the answer to that question, you'll need to find someone at the bank who does.  If you don't like the answer they give you, you'll need to find another bank. I would think that if the credit card is from Chase, and you are trying to deposit a credit card check into a Chase checking account, they should be able to do that instantly.  However, bank policy doesn't always make sense.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In case it's unfamiliar, blank checks given by your credit card organization are called credit card checks. These checks, when used, act as a funding source from your credit card. Be mindful though, as extracting such advances have additional charges than the usual credit card procedures. Fast forwarding, when you move to deposit these checks into your bank, the bank's rules dictate the time it will take for the check to be processed. They want to ensure the check's authenticity. If the bank assistant seems clueless, seek help from another employee who understands better. Don't hesitate to look for a new bank if you disagree with their response. You might imagine that if it's a Chase credit card, and you're attempting to drop a credit card check into a Chase checking account, there wouldn't be any delay. Though, bank regulations might surprise you occasionally.\n",

      "Reference Response:  My answer is specific to the US because you mentioned the Federal Reserve, but a similar system is in place in most countries. Do interest rates increase based on what the market is doing, or do they solely increase based on what the Federal Reserve sets them at? There are actually two rates in question here; the Wikipedia article on the federal funds rate has a nice description that I'll summarize here. The interest rate that's usually referred to is the federal funds rate, and it's the rate at which banks can lend money to each other through the Federal Reserve. The nominal federal funds rate - this is a target set by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve at each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). When you hear in the media that the Fed is changing interest rates, this is almost always what they're referring to. The actual federal funds rate - through the trading desk of the New York Federal Reserve, the FOMC conducts open market operations to enforce the federal funds rate, thus leading to the actual rate, which is the rate determined by market forces as a result of the Fed's operations. Open market operations involve buying and selling short-term securities in order to influence the rate. As an example, the current nominal federal funds rate is 0% (in economic parlance, this is known as the Zero Lower Bound (ZLB)), while the actual rate is approximately 25 basis points, or 0.25%. Why is it assumed that interest rates are going to increase when the Federal Reserve ends QE3? I don't understand why interest rates are going to increase. In the United States, quantitative easing is actually a little different from the usual open market operations the Fed conducts. Open market operations usually involve the buying and selling of short-term Treasury securities; in QE, however (especially the latest and ongoing round, QE3), the Fed has been purchasing longer-term Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). By purchasing MBS, the Fed is trying to reduce the overall risk of the commercial housing debt market. Furthermore, the demand created by these purchases drives up prices on the debt, which drives down interest rates in the commercial housing market. To clarify: the debt market I'm referring to is the market for mortgage-backed securities and other debt derivatives (CDO's, for instance). I'll use MBS as an example. The actual mortgages are sold to companies that securitize them by pooling them and issuing securities based on the value of the pool. This process may happen numerous times, since derivatives can be created based on the value of the MBS themselves, which in turn are based on housing debt. In other words, MBS aren't exactly the same thing as housing debt, but they're based on housing debt. It's these packaged securities the Fed is purchasing, not the mortgages themselves.  Once the Fed draws down QE3, however, this demand will probably decrease. As the Fed unloads its balance sheet over several years, and demand decreases throughout the market, prices will fall and interest rates in the commercial housing market will fall. Ideally, the Fed will wait until the economy is healthy enough to absorb the unloading of these securities.  Just to be clear, the interest rates that QE3 are targeting are different from the interest rates you usually hear about. It's possible for the Fed to unwind QE3, while still keeping the \"interest rate\", i.e. the federal funds rate, near zero. although this is considered unlikely. Also, the Fed can target long-term vs. short-term interest rates as well, which is once again slightly different from what I talked about above. This was the goal of the Operation Twist program in 2011 (and in the 1960's). Kirill Fuchs gave a great description of the program in this answer, but basically, the Fed purchased long-term securities and sold short-term securities, with the goal of twisting the yield curve to lower long-term interest rates relative to short-term rates. The goal is to encourage people and businesses to take on long-term debt, e.g. mortgages, capital investments, etc. My main question that I'm trying to understand is why interest rates are what they are. Is it more of an arbitrary number set by central banks or is it due to market activity? Hopefully I addressed much of this above, but I'll give a quick summary. There are many \"interest rates\" in numerous different financial markets. The rate most commonly talked about is the nominal federal funds rate that I mentioned above; although it's a target set by the Board of Governors, it's not arbitrary. There's a reason the Federal Reserve hires hundreds of research economists. No central bank arbitrarily sets the interest rate; it's determined as part of an effort to reach certain economic benchmarks for the foreseeable future, whatever those may be.  In the US, current Fed policy maintains that the federal funds rate should be approximately zero until the economy surpasses the unemployment and inflation benchmarks set forth by the Evans Rule (named after Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, who pushed for the rule). The effective federal funds rate, as well as other rates the Fed has targeted like interest rates on commercial housing debt, long-term rates on Treasury securities, etc. are market driven. The Fed may enter the market, but the same forces of supply and demand are still at work. Although the Fed's actions are controversial, the effects of their actions are still bound by market forces, so the policies and their effects are anything but arbitrary.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The paraphrased content addresses information specific to the US, as the Federal Reserve has been mentioned. This phenomenon is witnessed in other countries too. The query arises if market trends influence the surging interests rates or if they exclusively rely on the Federal Reserve's regulations. In reality, there are two rates pondered here. A concise explanation from the Wikipedia page on the federal funds rate is provided. Usually, the Federal Funds Rate is referred to, the rate designated for interbank lending via the Federal Reserve. A target rate is set by the Board of Governors at every Federal Open Market Committee meeting, commonly known as the Nominal Federal Funds Rate. This is predominantly what the media signifies when there's talk about rate changes by the Federal Reserve. In practice, the Federal Funds Rate is enforced through open market operations by the FOMC via the New York Federal Reserve's trading desk. This leads to market-driven rate determination as a result of these operations. The open market procedures include buying and selling short-term papers to sway the rate. As an illustration, the current rate is at 0%, also known as the Zero Lower Bound, while the actual rate is at about 0.25% or 25 basis points. Why is there an expectation of interest hikes following the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's QE3? The query of understanding the reason behind this has been raised.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States' approach to quantitative easing varies from traditional open market operations. Normally, the buying and selling of short-term Treasury securities take place; however, in the latest round known as QE3, the Federal Reserve has been procuring long-term Treasury papers and mortgage-backed securities. The reason behind purchasing MBS is to mitigate risk in the commercial housing debt sector. Furthermore, the demands driven by these purchases heighten prices, leading to lower interest rates in the commercial housing market. It's worth noting that the said \"debt market\" is specifically about mortgage-backed securities and other debt derivatives. For example, mortgages are sold to companies who pool them and release securities based on the collective value. This tends to occur repeatedly since derivatives can be formed based on the MBS value, derived from housing debt. In simpler terms, MBS comprises of housing debt. The Federal Reserve seeks to acquire these bundled securities, not actual mortgages. However, post-QE3, the demand may recede. As the Federal Reserve balances its books over multiple years while demand continues to lessen across the market, prices may slump, and commercial housing market interest rates may drop. In an ideal scenario, the Federal Reserve would consider unloading these securities once the economy rebounds\n",
      "\n",
      "To clarify, the interest rates targeted by QE3 contrast those we generally discuss. It is plausible for the Federal Reserve to roll back QE3 and maintain the Federal Funds Rate near zero, even though it's deemed unlikely. The Federal Reserve can target short-term as well as long-term interest rates, a strategy slighter different as discussed earlier. This was a principal objective of the Operation Twist program in both 2011 and the 1960s. The tactic was to persuade individuals and corporations to shoulder long-term debt like mortgages, capital investments etc. My question is understanding the reasoning behind the interest rates. Is it an arbitrary number set by central banks or is it influenced by market operations? I hope I have covered most of this, but here's a brief summary. There are several 'interest rates' across different financial markets. The most commonly referred rate is the nominal federal funds rate; however, it's not random. There's a logical reasoning behind why the Federal Reserve employs hundreds of research economists. No central bank arbitrarily designates the interest rate; it's decided keeping in mind certain economic benchmarks for the foreseeable future. \n",
      "\n",
      "As with current Fed policy in America, the federal funds rate needs to remain approximately zero until the economy surpasses the unemployment and inflation benchmarks according to the Evans Rule (named after Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago president Charles Evan who proposed this rule). The efficacious federal funds rate alongside other targeted rates such as those on interest rates for commercial housing debt, long-term rates on Treasury papers etc., are market driven. The Fed may participate in the market, however, the forces of supply and demand function as usual. Even though some controversy surrounds the Fed's decisions, the influence of their actions operate within the constraints of market forces, indicating the non-arbitrary nature of their policies and their subsequent effects.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The Dividend Discount Model is based on the concept that the present value of a stock is the sum of all future dividends, discounted back to the present. Since you said: dividends are expected to grow at a constant rate in perpetuity ... the Gordon Growth Model is a simple variant of the DDM, tailored for a firm in \"steady state\" mode, with dividends growing at a rate that can be sustained forever. Consider McCormick (MKC), who's last dividend was 31 cents, or $1.24 annualized. The dividend has been growing just a little over 7% annually. Let's use a discount, or hurdle rate of 10%. MKC closed today at $50.32, for what it's worth. The model is extremely sensitive to inputs. As g approaches r, the stock price rises to infinity. If g > r, stock goes negative. Be conservative with 'g' -- it must be sustainable forever.  The next step up in complexity is the two-stage DDM, where the company is expected to grow at a higher, unsustainable rate in the early years (stage 1), and then settling down to the terminal rate for stage 2. Stage 1 is the present value of dividends during the high growth period. Stage 2 is the Gordon Model, starting at the end of stage 1, and discounting back to the present. Consider Abbott Labs (ABT). The current annual dividend is $1.92, the current dividend growth rate is 12%, and let's say that continues for ten years (n), after which point the growth rate is 5% in perpetuity. Again, the discount rate is 10%. Stage 1 is calculated as follows: Stage 2 is GGM, using not today's dividend, but the 11th year's dividend, since stage 1 covered the first ten years. 'gn' is the terminal growth, 5% in our case. then... The value of the stock today is 21.22 + 51.50 = 72.72 ABT closed today at $56.72, for what it's worth.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The Dividend Discount Model (DDM) revolves around the idea that a stock's present worth equals the total of future dividends, reduced to today's value. You mentioned anticipating dividends to rise at a sustained speed indefinitely, which is where the Gordon Growth Model steps in. This model is basically a DDM variation designed specifically for companies experiencing stable growth with dividends increasing at a maintainable speed. Take a look at McCormick (MKC), their final recorded dividend was 31 cents or $1.24 on an annualized basis. It's noted that their dividend has slightly increased above 7% per year. For purposes of this model, we'll apply a discount or hurdle rate of 10%. MKC ended the day at a share price of $50.32. Bear in mind, the model is highly sensitive to applied factors. As the growth rate nears the discount rate, the share price infinitely expands. Should growth exceed the discount rate, the share price descends into negative. It's prudent to exercise caution with the growth rate as it should be sustainably applicable indefinitely. The framework's more intricately adapted form is the two-tier DDM where initial growth surpasses the sustainable rate and eventually relapses to it. The initial phase consists of the present dividend value during the double-digit growth epoch. The terminal phase applies the Gordon model from the end of the first phase, discounted back to the present. For instance, Abbott Labs (ABT) currently yields an annual dividend of $1.92 with a growth rate of 12%, projected to endure for a decade, following which it declines to a perpetual 5%. The discount rate remains 10%. The first phase calculations follow. The second stage is figured out with Gordon Growth Model but using the 11th year's dividend, as the first phase covers the first decade. 'gn' indicates terminal growth which is 5% in this scenario. Therefore... ABT's stock today values at 21.22 + 51.50, i.e., 72.72. ABT's market closing was $56.72 today.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I recommend pulling up a retirement calculator and having an honest conversation about how long term savings works, and the power of compound interest. Just by playing around with the sliders on an online calculator, you can demonstrate how the early years are the most important. Depending on how much they make now and are considering saving, delaying 5-10 years can easily leave 6-7 figures on the table. If it's specifically a child or close family member, I recommend pulling up your retirement account. Talk with them about how you managed it, and how much you were putting in. Perhaps show them how much is the principal and how much is interest. If you did well, tell them how. If you didn't do as well as you liked, tell them what you would have done differently. Finally, discuss a bit of psychology. Even if they don't have a professional job and are making minimum wage, getting into the habit of saving makes it easier when they eventually make more. A couple of dollars a month isn't much, but getting into the habit makes it easier to save a couple hundred dollars a month later on.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I advocate for using a pension planner and engaging in a frank discussion about the workings of prolonged saving and the impact of accumulated interest. Just by manipulating the controls on a digital estimator, you can illustrate why the initial years are critical. Depending on their current income and potential savings, a delay of five to ten years could potentially forfeit a large sum. If you're dealing with a kid or a close relative, I advise you to expose your own pension funds. Hold a chat about how you managed it and the financial contributions you made. Maybe reveal the difference between the principal amount and the interest. Share your success story or if things didn't go as planned, share the modifications you would have inserted. Wrap it up with understanding the human mind. Regardless of the job's nature and if they are earning the base wage, forming the habit to save at this stage will simplify things when their income increases. It might seem insignificant to save a few dollars every month now, but this habit could later facilitate saving several hundreds monthly.\n",

For payments which have a lag, e.g. a cheque that needs to be paid in or a bank transfer that takes a few days, you might also need to choose between multiple payment dates, e.g. when you initiated the payment or when it took effect. You can pick one as long as you're consistent: You can choose how you record when money is received or    paid (eg the date the money enters your account or the date a cheque   is written) but you must use the same method each tax year.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I think you're right that from a pure \"expected future value\" perspective, it makes sense to pay this loan off as quickly as possible (including not taking the next year's loan). The new student loans with the higher interest rates have changed the balance enough that it's no longer automatically better to keep it going as long as possible. The crucial point in your case, which isn't true for many people, is that you will likely have to pay it off eventually anyway and so in terms of net costs over your lifetime you will do best by paying it off quickly. A few points to set against that, that you might want to consider: Not paying it off is a good hedge against your career not going as well as you expect, e.g. if the economy does badly, you have health problems, you take a career break for any reason. If that happens, you would end up not being forced to pay it off, so will end up gaining from not having done so voluntarily. The money you save in that case could be more valuable to you that the money you would lose if your career does go well. Not paying it off will increase your net cash earlier in life when you are more likely to need it, e.g. for a house deposit. Having more free cash could increase your options, making it possible to buy a house earlier in life. Or it could mean you have a higher deposit when you do buy, reducing the interest rate on the entire mortgage balance. The savings from that could end up being more than the 6% interest on the loan even though when you look at the loan in isolation it seems like a very bad rate.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Seeing the full scope of the potential \"expected future value,\" you're accurate in your assessment that diligently repaying this loan as soon as feasible is the most sensible course of action (excluding taking out the loan for the upcoming year). The introduction of newer student loans, with their augmented interest rates, has altered the financial landscape, making it less favorable to extend the loan's lifespan indefinitely. A significant aspect in your situation, which isn't applicable to many others, is the looming inevitability of repayment - a factor that, concerning your net life expenses, leans towards the benefit of an expedited payment plan. Contemplations that might offer opposition to this standpoint include: Retaining your loan acts as a financial safety net in the event of unfavorable career or personal developments, such as economic decline, health issues, or unexpected sabbaticals. Such situations would eliminate forced repayment, and in doing so, offer a gain from not having voluntarily closed the loan. The resulting financial cushion could prove more beneficial than the monetary loss from a thriving career. Also, deferring repayment can boost your available cash sooner, particularly useful for significant purchases like home down payments. Greater financial freedom could potentially expedite home ownership or provide a larger down payment, in turn lowering the interest on your mortgage balance. This reduction could outnumber the 6% interest you would incur from the student loan, even though it may initially appear unfavorable when viewed separately.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I don't believe there is any particular structural or financial reason that outgoing wire transfers cost so much in Canada, their costs are no higher than other countries (and lower than many).  Wires seem to be an area where the Canadian banks have decided people don't comparison shop, so it's not a competitive advantage to offer a better price. The rates you quoted are on the low side: $80 for a largish international wire is not unusual, and HSBC charges up to $150! There are several alternative ways to transfer money domestically in Canada. If the recipient banks at the same bank, it's possible to go into a branch and transfer money directly from your own account to their account (I've never been charged for this).  The transfer is immediate.  But it couldn't be done online, last time I checked. For transfers where you don't know the recipients bank account, you can pay online with Interac E-Transfers, offered by most Canadian banks.  It's basically e-mailing money.  It usually costs $1 to $1.50 per transfer, and has limits on how much you can send per day/week. Each of the banks also have a bill-pay service, but unlike similar services in the US (where they mail a paper check if the recipient isn't on their system), each Canadian bank has a limited number of possible payees (mostly utilities, governments, major stores).\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  While I'm uncertain about the specific aspects or fiscal factors leading to the high cost of outgoing wire transfers in Canada, it's clear their expenses do not exceed those of other countries, in fact being cheaper in numerous cases. It appears that in the arena of wire transactions, Canadian banks have concluded that customers do not place importance on price comparison, rendering competitive pricing unnecessary. The charges you mentioned are fairly modest, with $80 as an average for expansive international wire transactions, and HSBC levying up to a staggering $150! Contrarily, the Canadian system presents various methods for domestic monetary transfers. Should the beneficiary have an account in the same banking institution, one could physically visit the branch to directly transfer money from their own account (in my experience, this service is free of charge). Such transfers are instant. Regrettably, as of my last update, these are not available to be carried out online. In situations where the recipient's bank details are unknown, one can utilize Interac E-Transfers, a service provided by most Canadian banks that allows for monetary transfers online. The service essentially equates to sending money via email. The usual charge ranges from $1 to $1.50 per transaction, with restrictions in place for daily/weekly transfer limits. Each bank also offers a 'pay-your-bills' service, a gateway for bill payments not unlike similar services provided in the United States, with the exception that instead of mailing a physical check to the recipient if not registered on their system, Canadian banks present a curtailed list of potential payees, predominantly comprising utilities, government bodies, and large-scale stores.\n",

However, there's also the introduction of alien trading species that's pushing stock market evolution. Notably, these exchanges are also low-key social clubs for robots.\n",

If you reply back, they'll confirm that Uncle Alex did indeed leave you $7 million, and you just need to send them a few thousand dollars for taxes and estate fees and then they'll wire you the money.  And then there'll be customs fees.  And then more taxes.  And of course, there will be separate import fees.  And so on until you run out of money.\n",

      "Reference Response:  In a very similar situation as yours, I bought a used motorcycle for $3000. It was still reasonably new, very reliable, and with California weather, you can use it year-round. It reduced my time in traffic, and it had very low fuel and maintenance costs. The biggest expense was tires. The biggest pitfall in buying a motorcycle is auto-insurance. Do your research and ask for quotes from your broker before even considering a particular model of bike. When I decided that my finances justified a new motorcycle, I was surprised that full collision coverage cost about $3000/year on a lower powered bike that had a bad accident record because it appealed to new riders. I got a much more powerful bike that appealed to more experienced riders and the premium was only $500/year. Is this answer not what you were looking for? Spend as little as you can on a 4-6 year old car. Drive it until you can save enough cash to buy the one you really want. I'm currently driving a 2007 Corolla, and I'm waiting until I can get a new civic turbo with a manual transmission to replace it. (They currently only offer them with a CVT, but next fall they'll have them with the MT, so I'm probably 2 1/2 years out from buying one used.)\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Based on an experience remarkably similar to yours, I acquired a pre-owned motorbike for $3000. Given the consistent California climate, the bike was a year-round option and was not only relatively new, but also dependable. The key advantages I experienced were the noticeable decline in my commute duration and extraordinarily low fuel and upkeep expenses, though replacing the tires proved to be the largest expenditure. It's critical to note that the most significant hurdle when procuring a motorbike is the auto-insurance. Be proactive in carrying out your research and obtaining estimates from your agent prior to settling on a specific motorcycle model. I found it surprising when I learned the cost of comprehensive coverage was around $3000 per annum, even for a less powerful bike that had recorded many accidents due to its appeal to beginner riders. On switching to a bike with greater power, more popular among seasoned riders, the premium plummeted to $500 annually. However, could this information be irrelevant to you? My suggestion, invest as little as possible on an automobile that's aged 4-6 years. Use it until you've saved enough for your dream ride. I'm currently behind the wheel of a 2007 Corolla, patiently waiting for the times to present me with a new Civic Turbo equipped with a manual gearbox to replace it. Currently, these models are only available with a CVT, but come next autumn, they will be available with MT. So, I anticipate about two and half years before I can buy one second-hand.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The stock price is not only based on the general market trend and the stock's current profitability and prospects, but is also based on prediction of how the stock's prospects might change in the future. In almost every case, there are professional investors analysing the stock's future prospects and considering whether it's over or under values for its current price. However even professionals can be totally wrong.  If you feel like you have a good grasp on whether the stock will have improving or declining prospects over time, then you might be (if you're right) equipped to make a sensible decision on whether to hold the stock or not. If you don't think you have a good understanding about the stock, then an understanding of the general market direction might at least make stock in general worth holding. Otherwise, you are simply taking a punt. If you know of another stock that has better prospects, then ask yourself why you would hold onto the stock that you think will perform worse.  But also bear in mind that (in my understanding) research has shown that, on average, people who try to pick stocks rarely do better than a random selection, and more stock trades means more brokerage (which thanks to brokerage losses would mean you will end up doing worse than average unless you really do know better than the market).\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The stock value doesn't just reflect current market tendencies and the stock's existing profitability and potential, but also factors in estimations of its future shifts. Numerous times, expert investors scrutinize the stock's future potential and evaluate whether it's over or underpriced. Still, these experts can fall short. If you're confident about your understanding of the stock's future trajectory, you may possess the ability to make balanced decisions about keeping the stock or not. If you lack insight into the stock, basic market trend knowledge might still make stock holding beneficial. Otherwise, it's just a gamble. If you're aware of an alternative stock with promising potential, you need to question the purpose of retaining a less promising one. However, according to my knowledge, studies reveal that individuals attempting to select stocks rarely perform better than a random choice, and an increase in stock trades equates to increased brokerages. This, due to brokerage losses, means you'll likely underperform unless you truly have a superior understanding of the market.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Disclaimer: I work in life insurance, but I am not an agent.   First things first, there is not enough information here to give you an answer.  When discussing life insurance, the very first things we need to fully consider are the illustration of policy values, and the contract itself.  Without these, there is no way to tell if this is a good idea or not. So what are the things to look for? A. Risk appetite.  People love to discuss projections of the market, like for example, \"7-8% a year compounded annually\".  Go look at the historical returns of the stock market.  It is never close to that projection.  Life insurance, however, can give you a GUARANTEED return (this would be show in the 'Guaranteed' section of the life insurance illustration).  As long as you pay your premiums, this money is guaranteed to accrue.  Now most life insurance companies also show 'Non-Guaranteed' elements in their illustrations - these are non-guaranteed projections based on a scale at this point in time.  These columns will show how your cash value may grow when dividends are credited to your policy (and used to buy paid-up additional insurance, which generates more dividends - this can be compared to the compounding nature of interest).   B. Tax treatment.  I am definitely not an expert in this area, but life insurance does have preferential tax treatment, particularly to your beneficiaries. C. Beneficiaries.  Any death benefit (again, listed as guaranteed and maybe non-guaranteed values) is generally completely tax free for the beneficiary. D. Strategy.  Tying all of this together, what exactly is the point of this?  To transfer wealth, to accrue wealth, or some combination thereof?  This is important and unstated in your question. So again, without knowing more, there is no way to answer your question.  But I am surprised that in this forum, so many people are quick to jump in and say in general that whole life insurance is a scam.  And even more surprising is the fact the accepted answer has already been accepted. My personal take is that if you are just trying to accrue wealth, you should probably stick to the market and maybe buy term if you want a death benefit component.  This is mostly due to your age (higher risk of death = higher premiums = lower buildup) and how long of a time period you have to build up money in the policy.  But if a 25 year old asked this same question, depending on his purposes, I may suggest that a WL policy is in fact a good idea.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Just to clarify, although I am employed in the life insurance sector, I am not a broker. To begin, the information provided here is insufficient to give a conclusive answer. Vital aspects to consider when discussing life insurance are policy value illustrations and the policy contract itself. These are crucial to determine whether it's a wise investment or not. So, what should you be paying attention to? A. Risk-taking mindset. Market forecasts are often popular topics of discussion, for instance, compounding annual returns of \"7-8%\". Historical stock market returns highlight that such projections are typically off-track. Nevertheless, life insurance can offer a secure return, displayed in the 'Assured' section of the life insurance illustration. Provided that you meet your premium payments, the buildup of this money is guaranteed. Most insurers also list 'Non-Assured' components in their illustrations, these are non-assured forecasts based on current figures. These columns demonstrate a potential growth in cash value when policy dividends are accounted for (and utilized to acquire additional paid-up insurance, leading to more dividends which resemble the compounding nature of interest).  B. Tax aspects. I am not particularly proficient in this field, but life insurance does often come with tax benefits, mostly to your beneficiaries. C. Beneficiaries. Any death benefit (displayed as apparent and potential non-apparent values) is typically tax-exempt for the beneficiary. D. Approach. Incorporate all elements, it’s important to determine the ultimate goal - wealth accumulation, transfer, or both? This element is not clearly stated in your question. Without more details, I am unable to provide an appropriate response. However, I find it puzzling that numerous individuals in this platform immediately dismiss whole life insurance as fraudulent. More shocking is the fact that an answer has already been accepted. In my opinion, if your goal is wealth accumulation, it might be better to rely on the market and perhaps purchase term insurance for a death benefit element. This is largely influenced by your age (higher chances of death lead to higher premiums thus reducing accumulation) and the length of time you have to save money in the policy. But if a 25-year-old posed the same query, depending on their objectives, I might recommend that a WL policy is indeed a favourable option.\n",

After a year of putting money aside, he can plan to use and budget this for any other expenses.\n",

In instances when he receives more than this predicted minimum, the surplus ought to be saved.

      "Reference Response:  Fund rebalancing typically refers to changing the investment mix to stay within the guidelines of the mutual fund objective.  For example, lets say a fund is supposed to have at least 20% in bonds.  Because of a dramatic increase in stock price and decrease in bond values it finds itself with only 19.9% in bonds at the end of the trading day.  The fund manager would sell sufficient equities to reduce its equity holdings and buy more bonds.   Rebalancing is not always preferential because it could cause capital gain distribution, typically once per year, without selling the fund.  And really any trading within the fun could do the same. In the case you cite the verbiage is confusing.  Often times I wonder if the author knows less then the reader.  It might also be a bit of a rush to get the article out, and the author did not write correctly. I agree that the ETFs cited are suitable for short term traders.  However, that is because, traditionaly, the market has increased in value over the long term.  If you bet it will go down over the long term, you are almost certain to lose money. Like you, I cannot figure out how rebalancing makes this suitable only for short term traders.  If the ETFs distribute capital gains events much more frequently then once per year, that is worth mentioning, but does not provide a case for short versus long term traders.   Secondly, I don't think these funds are doing true rebalancing.  They might change investments daily for the most likely profitable outcome, but that really isn't rebalancing.   It seems the author is confused.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Repositioning of assets, commonly known as fund rebalancing, is all about tweaking your portfolio to align with the aim of your mutual fund. Think about a situation where a fund's objective is to allocate at least 20% to bonds. Suppose the fund ends up with 19.9% in bonds due to a significant rise in the share price coupled with a decline in bond values. The fund manager's response would be to sell enough stocks to trim its equity exposure and augment the bonds. However, periodic rebalancing isn't always beneficial as it may result in a capital gains distribution, generally annually, without any fund selling. Actually, any fund transaction could lead to the same outcome. The context you offered contains some confusion. One often ponders if the writer is less informed than the readers themselves. It could be a hurried attempt to publish the article, leading to erroneous writing. I do agree that the mentioned ETFs do suit the needs of transient traders. The rationale behind this is that historically, the market ascends in the long run. On the contrary, betting on the market's decline over an extended period will likely lead to your financial loss. I, like you, am puzzled on how frequent rebalancing makes it appropriate solely for temporary investors. Should the ETFs distribute capital gain events more than once annually, it's worth noting, but doesn't argue for short- against long-term investors. In addition, I don't believe these funds are genuinely rebalancing. They might choose to shuffle investments daily for potentially higher profit, but this practice can't be labeled as rebalancing. It appears that the writer is mixing up things.\n",

      "Reference Response:  You can look at buying a house as being a long term investment in not paying rent.   In the short time there are costs to buying (legal, taxes, etc).   This depends on only buying house of the size/location you need e.g. no better then what you would have rented. House buying tent to work out best when there is high inflation, as the rent you would otherwise be paying goes up with  inflation – provided you can live with the short term pain of high interest rates.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Consider the prospect of purchasing a property as a long-term strategy to avoid paying rent. Initially, there will be financial outlays such as taxes, legal services, and so forth. This only holds true if you aim to buy a property similar to the size and location of what you would typically rent – nothing superior.

      "Reference Response:  A minor tangent. One can claim the S&P has a mean return of say 10%, and standard deviation of say 14% or so, but when you run with that, you find that the actual returns aren't such a great fit to the standard bell curve. Market anomalies producing the \"100-year flood\" far more often than predicted over even a 20 year period. This just means that the model doesn't reflect reality at the tails, even if the +/- 2 standard deviations look pretty. This goes for the Black-Sholes (I almost abbreviated it to initials, then thought better, I actually like the model) as well. The distinction between American and European is small enough that the precision of the model is wider than the difference of these two option styles. I believe if you look at the model and actual pricing, you can determine the volatility of a given stock by using prices around the strike price, but when you then model the well out of money options, you often find the market creating its own valuation.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  A brief diversion. It's possible to argue that the S&P yields an average return of around 10%, and a standard deviation of approximately 14%, yet when these figures are applied, the actual returns seem to diverge from the ideal gaussian distribution. The market irregularities cause \"century floods\" more frequently than forecasted even within two decades. This simply implies that the model fails to accurately depict the extremes, despite the +/- 2 standard deviations appearing satisfactory. This is also applicable to the Black-Sholes model (I refrained from shortening it to the acronym, because I genuinely appreciate this model). The variance between the American and European styles is minor enough that the model's accuracy surpasses the disparity of the two option approaches. I posit that if you examine both the model and actual pricing, you can ascertain a particular stock's volatility by examining prices close to the strike price. Yet, when modeling far off money options, the market appears to create its own value assessment, often leading to discrepancies.\n",

      "Reference Response:  If your requirements are hard (must have $1000/month, must have the same or bigger in capital at the end), stocks are a poor choice of investment. However, in many cases, people are willing to tolerate some level of risk to achieve the expected returns. You also do not mention inflation, which can take quite a lot out of your portfolio over the course of ten years. If we make some simplifying assumptions, you want to generate $12,000 a year. You can realistically expect the (whole) stock market, long term (i.e. over time periods substantially longer than 10 years), to return approximately 4 - 5% after factoring in inflation. That means an investment of $240,000 - $300,000 (the math is simplified somewhat here). If you don't care about inflation, you can up the percentage rather somewhat. According to this article, the S&P 500 returned an average of 11.31% from 1928 through 2010 (not factoring in inflation), which would require an investment of approximately $106,100. But! This opens you up to substantial risk. The stock market may go down 30% this year! According to the above article, the S&P returned only 3.54% from 2001 to 2010. Long-term, it goes up, but your investment case is really unsuited to investing in an index to the entire stock market given your requirements. You may be better suited investing primarily in stable bonds, or perhaps a mix of bonds and stocks. Alternatively, you may want to consider even more stable investments such as treasury notes. Treasury notes are all but guaranteed, but with a lousy rate of return. Heck, you could consider a GIC (that may be Canada-only) or even a savings account. There's also the possibility of purchasing an annuity, though almost everyone will advise against such. Personally, I'd go for a mutual fund which invested approximately 70% bonds and the rest in stocks over such a time period. Something like ING Direct's Streetwise Balanced Income Portfolio, if you were in Canada. It substantially lowers your expected return but also lowers your risk. I can't honestly say what the expected return there is; at this point, it's returned 4% per year (before inflation), but has been around only since the beginning of 2008. And to be clear, this is absolutely not free of risk.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  If your investment prerequisites are stringent such as expecting a monthly return of $1000 or maintaining the principal amount, then stocks aren't an ideal investment option. Often, individuals are prepared to accept some degree of risk to meet their prospective returns. Inflation, which you haven't considered, can significantly impact portfolio returns over a decade. To simplify things, if you aim for $12,000 annually, you'd require an initial investment of $240,000 - $300,000, given the long-term returns from the whole stock market hover between 4-5% after inflation adjustment. If inflation doesn't concern you, you can expect a higher return percentage. Based on an article, from 1928 through 2010, the S&P 500 garnered an average return of 11.31%(without adjusting for inflation), necessitating around $106,100 capital. However, this carries substantial risk, as markets can plummet by 30%. The same article states that from 2001 to 2010, S&P delivered a mere 3.54% return. Over the long haul, market ascends but your investment prerequisites aren't best suited for an all-encompassing market index. Stable bond investments or a combination of bonds and stocks could be a better investment for you. You might think about safer choices like Treasury bills. Despite their low yields, their returns are virtually assured. Other options could be a GIC (may be exclusive to Canada) or just a plain savings account. You could even purchase an annuity, but this is generally discouraged. My personal preference would be a mutual fund comprised of 70% bonds and the balance in stocks over this timeline, something akin to ING Direct's Streetwise Balanced Income Portfolio (if Canadian resident). This minimizes both expected returns and related risks. The expected return on this is uncertain; it has so far yielded 4% per annum (pre-inflation) since its inception in early 2008. But beware, this too involves risk.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Depends. If you can choose where to relocate to, then I second the \"no income tax\" states. But even of these chose wisely, some have no income taxes at all, others have taxes on some kinds of income. Some don't have neither individual nor corporate taxes, some tax businesses in some ways. Some compensate with higher property taxes, others compensate with higher sales taxes. On the other hand, you might prefer states with income taxes but no sales taxes. It can happen if your current income is going to be low, but you'll be spending your savings. If you don't have a choice (for example, your employer wants you to move closer to their office), then you're more limited. Still, you can use the tax break on moving expenses (read the fine print, there are certain employment requirements), and play with the state taxes (if you're moving to a state with less/no taxes - move earlier, if its the other way - move later). Check out for cities that have income taxes. In some states it cannot happen by law (for example, in California only the state is allowed to collect income taxes), in others it is very common (Ohio comes to mind). Many things to consider in New York. New York City has its own income tax (as well as Yonkers, as far as I remember these are the only ones in the State of New York). So if you want to save on taxes in NYS but live close to the city, consider White Plains etc. If you work in NYC its moot, you're going to pay city taxes anyway. That is also true if you live in NJ but work in the city, so tax-wise it may be more efficient not to live across state lines from your place of work.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  It's a mixed bag really. If the choice of moving locations is in your hands, I'll echo what others suggest with \"no income tax\" territories. Yet, don't jump in blind. Some don't charge any income tax, while others tax specific types of income. Some places don't levy individual or corporate taxes, while others apply tax regulations in various ways on businesses. Certain regions may balance it up with amplified property or sales taxes. Alternatively, you might find states that impose income taxes but completely omit sales tax appealing, especially if you foresee a reduction in your current earnings and plan to live off your reserves. However, if you're at the mercy of your employer's request to be near the workplace, your options become constrained. You can still take advantage of a tax cut on relocation costs, but remember there are qualifying conditions tied to your job. Strategize around state taxes by moving at an optimal time; move sooner if you're headed to a less/no-tax state, delay otherwise. Be aware, certain cities impose income tax. This varies across states, being prohibited by law like in California, to fairly common occurrences like in Ohio. New York offers a complex scenario. Notably, New York City has its own income tax, shared with Yonkers in the state of New York. Hence, to optimize your tax costs in New York, but not compromise on staying close to the city - White plains can be a good choice. Now, if you're working in NYC, you're bound to pay city taxes regardless. The same applies if you're living in NJ but working in the city. Hence, as a tax-saving strategy, it might be prudent avoiding living across the state borders from your work location.\n",

Unless you used all of it for gifts during your life time, it will more than cover all of your $70K estate, so there's no need in any additional planning.

      "Reference Response:  I compared investing in real estate a few years ago to investing in stocks that paid double digit dividends (hard to find, however, managing and maintaining real estate is just as hard).  After discussing with many in the real estate world, I counted the average and learned that most averaged about 6 - 8% on real estate after taxes.  This does not include anything else like Dilip mentions (maintenance, insurance, etc).  For those who want to avoid that route, you can buy some companies that invest in real estate or REIT funds like Dilip mentions.  However, they are also susceptible to the problems mentioned above this. In terms of other investment opportunities like stocks or funds, think about businesses that will always be around and will always be needed.  We won't outgrow our need for real estate, but we won't outgrow our need for food or tangible goods either.  You can diversify into these companies along with real estate or buy a general mutual fund. Finally, one of your best investments is your career field - software.  Do some extra work on the side and see if you can get an adviser position at a start-up (it's actually not that hard and it will help you build your skill set) or create a site which generates passive revenue (again, not that hard).  One software engineer told me a few years ago that the stock market is a relic of the past and the new passive income would be generated by businesses that had tools which did all the work through automation (think of a smart phone application that you build once, yet continues to generate revenue).  This was right before the crash, and after it, everyone talked about another \"lost decade.\"  While it does require extra work initially, like all things software related, you'll be discovering tools in programming that you can use again and again in other applications - meaning your first one may be the most difficult. All it takes in this case is one really good idea ...\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Several years ago, I evaluated real estate investments against stocks yielding high dividends, a rarity but challenging as the maintenance of properties. Interacting extensively within the real estate sphere, the average return on investment after taxes was estimated to be around 6 to 8%, not considering factors like maintenance, insurance, etc. that Dilip refers to. For those seeking to evade the aforementioned route, firms that invest in real estate or real estate investment trust funds as suggested by Dilip could be options, albeit these too are prone to similar challenges. Also, consider investments like stocks or funds in industries that have continued relevance and demand, e.g., we wouldn't lose our need for housing, food, or physical goods. Diversification into these sectors, in conjunction with real estate or general mutual funds, is possible. Moreover, focus on strengthening your professional area - software engineering. Seek advisory roles in start-ups or develop a site that can earn passively.

      "Reference Response: Reference Response:  You can and are supposed to report self-employment income on Schedule C (or C-EZ if eligible, which a programmer likely is) even when the payer isn't required to give you 1099-MISC (or 1099-K for a payment network now). From there, after deducting permitted expenses, it flows to 1040 (for income tax) and Schedule SE (for self-employment tax). See https://www.irs.gov/individuals/self-employed for some basics and lots of useful links. If this income is large enough your tax on it will be more than $1000, you may need to make quarterly estimated payments (OR if you also have a 'day job' have that employer increase your withholding) to avoid an underpayment penalty. But if this is the first year you have significant self-employment income (or other taxable but unwithheld income like realized capital gains) and your economic/tax situation is otherwise unchanged -- i.e. you have the same (or more) payroll income with the same (or more) withholding -- then there is a 'safe harbor': if your withholding plus estimated payments this year is too low to pay this year's tax but it is enough to pay last year's tax you escape the penalty. (You still need to pay the tax due, of course, so keep the funds available for that.) At the end of the first year when you prepare your return you will see how the numbers work out and can more easily do a good estimate for the following year(s). A single-member LLC or 'S' corp is usually disregarded for tax purposes, although you can elect otherwise, while a (traditional) 'C' corp is more complicated and AIUI out-of-scope for this Stack; see https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/business-structures for more.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Freelance income, such as that from programming, must be declared via Schedule C (or C-EZ if applicable) even if the payer doesn't issue a 1099-MISC or a 1099-K form. After deducting accepted costs, this income should be included in 1040 and Schedule SE forms for income and self-employment tax respectively. For detailed guidelines and helpful resources, refer to the IRS website at https://www.irs.gov/individuals/self-employed. If the earnings from self-employment are relatively large and exceed $1000 in tax obligations, you might need to make estimated quarterly payments, or increase your withholding if you're also in salaried employment to prevent penalties for underpayment. But there's a safety net for those seeing significant self-employment income or other untaxed income such as capital gains for the first time – if your withholding plus estimated payments don't cover current year's tax burden but are adequate to cover last year's, you can steer clear of the penalty. Though, it's important to keep funds handy to pay the due tax. After a year of this, when you file your returns, you'll be better placed to estimate future taxes. For tax purposes, a one member LLC or 'S' Corporation are generally ignored, although you can opt differently.

      " If you want to make money while European equities markets are crashing and the Euro itself is devaluing: None of these strategies are to be taken lightly. All involve risk. There are probably numerous ways that you can lose even though it seems like you should win. Transaction fees could eat your profits, especially if you have only a small amount of capital to invest with. The worst part is that they all involve timing. If you think the crash is coming next week, you could, say, buy a bunch of puts. But if the crash doesn't come for another 6 months, all of your puts are going to expire worthless and you've lost all of your capital. Even worse, if you sell short an index ETF this week in advance of next week's impending crash, and some rescue package arrives over the weekend, equity prices could spike at the beginning of the week and you'd be screwed.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Taking advantage of the European stock market crash and the Euro's depreciation to earn profit isn't a task that should be underestimated. Each plan presents a degree of hazard. There's a multitude of ways you could potentially fail even when victory appears inevitable. On top of this, overheads from transactions could consume your earnings, particularly if your investment capital isn't substantial. The most challenging aspect is that each strategy demands perfect timing. For example, you might opt to buy a considerable amount of put options if you predict an imminent crash. However, if the downturn doesn't occur until half a year later, your options will be useless, and your entire investment would be lost. Worse still, if you decide to short-sell an index ETF this week anticipating an upcoming disaster, and a financial aid package is announced over the weekend, the stock prices may surge at Monday's market open, and you'd be in a tough spot.\n",

Share price is meaningless.   Google is $700 per share, Apple is $100 per share, that doesn't say anything about either company and/or whether or not one is a better investment over the other. You should not evaluate an investment decision on price of a share.  Look at the books decide if the company is worth owning, then decide if it's worth owning at it's current price.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I was contemplating if the stock's worth lies in the actual stock value, and not in its individual shares, though I'm uncertain. You're right. The cost per share holds no real importance. For instance, Google's shares may be at $700, while Apple's are at $100, but these figures in isolation don't provide an accurate representation of the firms or offer insight into which one could be a smarter investment choice.

I would tell them if they have cashed it, that is even more evidence the deal was finalized. But even if they they didn't cash it, it only proves they are very disorganized.

      "Reference Response:  At twenty-two, you can have anywhere between 100%-70% of your securities portfolio in equities. It is reasonable to start at 100% and reduce over time.  The one thing that I would mention with that is that your target at retirement should be 70% stocks/30% bonds.  You should NEVER have more than 30% bonds.  Why?  Because a 70/30 mix is both safer than 100% bonds and will give a higher return.  Absent some market timing strategy (which as an amateur investor, you should absolutely avoid) or some complicated balancing scheme, there is never a reason to be at more than 30% bonds.   A 50/50 mix of stocks and bonds or a 100% bonds ratio not only returns less than the 70/30 mix, it is actually riskier.  Why?  Because sometimes bonds fall.  And when they do, stocks generally gain.  And vice versa.  Because of this behavior, the 70/30 mix is less likely to fall than 50% or 100% bonds.   Does that mean that your stock percentage should never drop below 70%?  No.  If your portfolio contains things other than stocks and bonds, it is reasonable for stocks to fall below 70%.  The problem is that when you drop stocks below 70%, you should drop bonds below 30% as well.  So you keep the stock to bond ratio at 7:3.   If you want to get a lower risk than a 70/30 mix, then you should move into cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents are actually safer than stocks and bonds either individually or in combination.  But at twenty-two, you don't really need more safety.   At twenty-two, the first thing to do is to build your emergency fund.  This should be able to handle six months of expenses without income.  I recommend making it equal to six months of your income.  The reason being that it is easy to calculate your income and difficult to be sure of expenses.  Also, you can save six months of income at twenty-two.   Are you going to stay where you are for the next five years?  At twenty-two, the answer is almost certainly no.  But the standard is the five year time frame.  If you want a bigger place or one that is closer to work, then no.  If you stay somewhere at least five years, then it is likely that the advantages to owning rather than renting will outweigh the costs of switching houses.  Less than five years, the reverse is true.  So you should probably rent now.   You can max out your 401k and IRA now.  Doing so even with a conservative strategy will produce big returns by sixty-seven.  And perhaps more importantly, it helps keep your spending down.  The less you do spend, the less you will feel that you need to spend.   Once you fill your emergency fund, start building savings for a house.  I would consider putting them in a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).  A REIT will tend to track real estate.  Since you want to buy real estate with the results, this is its own kind of safety.  It fell in value?  Houses are probably cheap.  Houses increasing in price rapidly?  A REIT is probably growing by leaps and bounds.  You do this outside your retirement accounts, as you want to be able to access it without penalty.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  At the age of twenty-two, you can diversify your investment portfolio with 70-100% equities. It is entirely feasible to start at the apex and gradually trim it down. Keep in mind, your goal upon retirement should be 70% equities and 30% bonds. Your bond holdings must never exceed 30%. Why? Simply because a 70/30 distribution is not only safer than having 100% in bonds but also guarantees greater returns. Do not get caught up in market timing strategies or complex balancing plans as a beginner investor, as there is no reason to have more than 30% in bonds. An equal distribution of stocks and bonds, or even a portfolio comprised entirely of bonds, not only yields less than the 70/30 mix, but it introduces more risk. Why? The simple reason is that bonds can decrease in value, and usually when they do, stocks see an increase and vise versa. A 70/30 division is less likely to suffer a fall compared to a 50% bond or 100% bond portfolio. Does this imply that you should always maintain a minimum of 70% stocks? Not necessarily. It is possible for your portfolio to hold other assets apart from stocks and bonds. But ensure to concurrently reduce your bond holdings below 30% if your stock holdings fall below 70%. Aim to maintain a 7:3 stock-bond ratio. If lower risks are desired, consider moving into monetary equivalents that are even safer than stocks and bonds as standalone or mixed investments. But safety might not be your immediate concern at twenty-two. Instead, focus on creating an emergency fund capable of supporting your expenses for a half a year without any income. It is recommended to aim for a fund equivalent of half a year of your earnings as it simplifies calculations and matches your earning potential at twenty-two. Do you see yourself living at your current address for the next five years? Probably not, given your age. If you're planning to upgrade your living space or move somewhere convenient, renting may be a better option until you hit the five-year mark wherein the benefits of homeownership start to outweigh the costs of frequently changing residences. Ensure to capitalize on your 401k and IRA now for substantial future returns and a helpful handle on your expenditure. Start building your house savings once your emergency fund is complete. You could consider utilizing a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) for these savings as it trends with property markets, providing a level of inherent safety. If the value falls, houses are probably affordable; if house prices shoot up, your REIT will likely be flourishing. This financial move should be separate from your retirement funds to avoid penalties when accessed.\n",

I work with banks where it happens the moment I submit the transaction (so the next screen already shows the new totals), and I work with banks that make it take 3 days. In the past, Sparkasse and Raifeissenkassen were especially famous to take a looong time ('Wir nehmen mehr als Geld und Zinsen...' - they supposedly work with the money inbetween, as it is gone from the source account but not arrived in the target account yet); that might have changed (or not).

      "Reference Response:  The short answer is the annualised volatility over twenty years should be pretty much the same as the annualised volatility over five years. For independent, identically distributed returns the volatility scales proportionally. So for any number of monthly returns T, setting the annualization factor m = 12 annualises the volatility.  It should be the same for all time scales.  However, note the discussion here: https://quant.stackexchange.com/a/7496/7178 Scaling volatility [like this] only is mathematically correct when the   underlying price model is driven by Geometric Brownian motion which   implies that prices are log normally distributed and returns are   normally distributed. Particularly the comment: \"its a well known fact that volatility is overestimated when scaled over long periods of time without a change of model to estimate such \"long-term\" volatility.\" Now, a demonstration.  I have modelled 12,000 monthly returns with mean = 3% and standard deviation = 2, so the annualised volatility should be Sqrt(12) * 2 = 6.9282.   Calculating annualised volatility for return sequences of various lengths (3, 6, 12, 60 months etc.) reveals an inaccuracy for shorter sequences.  The five-year sequence average got closest to the theoretically expected figure (6.9282), and, as the commenter noted \"volatility is [slightly] overestimated when scaled over long periods of time\". Annualised volatility for varying return sequence lengths  Edit re. comment Reinvesting returns does not affect the volatility much.  For instance, comparing some data I have handy, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Capital Returns (CR) versus Net Returns (NR).  The return differences are somewhat smoothed, 0.1% each month, 0.25% every third month.  More erratic dividend reinvestment would increase the volatility.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In simple terms, the fluctuation rate measured over two decades should closely mirror that recorded over a half-decade. If all factors remain equal, this change should be proportional. By selecting the annualization factor m = 12, the fluctuation rate can be annualized consistently across different time frames. However, remember to consider the insights shared here: https://quant.stackexchange.com/a/7496/7178 Adjusting fluctuation rate in this manner is only accurate if the pricing model employed is driven by Geometric Brownish motion which insinuates that prices stick to a log-normal distributuion and profits to a normal distribution. Here is a critical remark to keep in mind: \"it is universally acknowledged that fluctuation rates are usually overvalued when adjusted over extensive periods without amending the model to evaluate such 'long-term' volatility.\" For instance, I've simulated 12,000 monthly profits with an average equals to 3% and a deviation equals to 2; as a result, the expected annualized fluctuation rate should be Sqrt(12)*2 = 6.9282. Yet, when this fluctuation rate was calculated for multiple return sequences of different durations (3, 6, 12, 60 months and so on), there were minor discrepancies for the short ones. The closest match to the expected fluctuation rate (6.9282) was the five-year sequence. This supports the idea that \"fluctuation [slightly] outvalues estimates when stretched out over extended durations\". Hence, fluctuation rates for different return sequences can vary. A more nuanced take, Reinvestment of profits doesn't majorly affect fluctuation rates. For instance, with some accessible data, let's compare the Dow Jones Industrial Average Capital Returns (CR) versus Net Returns (NR). The differences in returns appear to be slightly steady - 0.1% each month and 0.25% every three months. A more random dividend reinvestment could potentially increase the fluctuation rate.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Wyoming is a good state for this. It is inexpensive and annual compliance is minimal. Although Delaware has the best advertising campaign, so people know about it, the reality is  that there are over 50 states/jurisdictions in the United States with their own competitive incorporation laws to attract investment (as well as their own legislative bodies that change those laws), so you just have to read the laws to find a state that is favorable for you. What I mean is that whatever Delaware does to get in the news about its easy business laws, has been mimicked and done even better by other states by this point in time. And regarding Delaware's Chancery Court, all other states in the union can also lean on Delaware case law, so this perk is not unique to Delaware. Wyoming is cheaper than Delaware for nominal presence in the United States, requires less information then Delaware, and is also tax free. A \"registered agent\" can get you set up and you can find one to help you with the address dilemma. This should only cost $99 - $200 over the state fees. An LLC does not need to have an address in the United States, but many registered agents will let you use their address, just ask. Many kinds of businesses still require a bank account for domestic and global trade. Many don't require any financial intermediary any more to receive payments. But if you do need this, then opening a bank account in the United States will be more difficult. Again, the registered agent or lawyer can get a Tax Identification Number for you from the IRS, and this will be necessary to open a US bank account.  But it is more likely that you will need an employee or nominee director in the United States to go in person to a bank and open an account. This person needs to be mentioned in the Operating Agreement or other official form on the incorporation documents. They will simply walk into a bank with your articles of incorporation and operating agreement showing that they are authorized to act on behalf of the entity and open a bank account. They then resign, and this is a private document between the LLC and the employee. But you will be able to receive and accept payments and access the global financial system now. A lot of multinational entities set up subsidiaries in a number of countries this way.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Choosing Wyoming as your base is excellent, due to low costs and bare minimum annual requirements. Although Delaware is famous for its inviting business laws, the truth is every state provides its unique blend of laws to promote investment. It's not exclusive to Delaware, as all states are aware of their trade tactics and have developed similar or superior strategies. Furthermore, Delaware's Chancery Court rulings can benefit any state, enhancing its uniqueness. Wyoming proves to be more economical than Delaware, requiring less paperwork and being tax-free. By consulting a registered agent, you could overcome the issues of address and start-up. Costs would range from $99 - $200 excluding the state fees. While an LLC doesn't require a U.S. address, your agent could let you use their address. Domestic and international businesses usually require bank accounts. Even if your business doesn't require any financial involvement, acquiring a U.S. bank account is not an easy path. Your agent or lawyer might assist in obtaining a Tax Identification Number from the IRS, which is crucial for opening a U.S. bank account. More often than not, you might need a nominee director or employee in the U.S. to physically visit a bank and open the account. After they are included in the Operating Agreement for official inauguration documents, they can open a bank account presenting the operating agreement and incorporation articles. Afterward, they resign, and the documentation stays within the LLC and the devoted employee. This would allow the reception and acceptance of payments while simultaneously reaching global financial systems. Corporations worldwide often adopt this method by establishing subsidiary entities in numerous countries.\n",

So on one hand, it's common to advise individuals just starting out to use mutual funds, specifically index funds with low fees. On the flip side, holding stocks has no annual fee, and if you are buying for the long term, you may still be better off with an eye toward cost, and learn over time.  In theory, an individual stands a better chance to beat the experts for a number of reasons, no shareholders to answer to, and the ability to purchase without any disclosure, among them. In reality, most investor lag the average by such a wide margin, they'd be best off indexing and staying in for the long term.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Smaller transactions can evoke an imbalanced cost due to commission expenses. Even a trading charge of $5 constitutes a 5% commission on a $100 purchase. Thus, beginners are advised to lean towards mutual funds, primarily those with affordable fees such as index funds. Conversely, owning stocks doesn't involve a yearly fee, so long-term purchasing might be beneficial with a focus on reducing costs and gaining insight over time. Theoretically, an individual could outperform professionals due to several factors, including a lack of accountability to shareholders and the capability to make acquisitions without needing to disclose them.

      "Reference Response:  It certainly is possible for a run on the bank to drive it into insolvency.  And yes, if the bank makes some bad loans, it can magnify the problem. Generally, this does not happen, though.  Remember that banks usually have lots of customers, and people are depositing money and making mortgage payments every day, so there is usually enough on-hand to cover average banking withdrawl activity, regardless of any bad loans they have outstanding. Banks have lots of historical data to know what the average withdrawl demands are for a given day.  They also have risk models to predict the likelihood of their loans going into default.  A bank will generally use this information to strike a healthy balance between profit-making activity (e.g. issuing loans), and satisfying its account holders. In the event of a major withdrawl demand, there are some protections in place to guard against insolvency. There are regulations that specify a Reserve Requirement.  The bank must keep a certain amount of money on hand, so they can't take huge risks by loaning out too much money all at once.  Regulators can tweak this requirement over time to reflect the current economic situation. If a bank does run into trouble, it can take out a short-term loan.  Either from another bank, or from the central bank (e.g. the US Federal Reserve).  Banks don't want to pay interest on loans any more than you do, so if they are regularly borrowing money, they will adjust thier cash reserves accordingly. If all else fails and the bank can't meet its obligations (e.g. the Fed loan fell through), the bank has an insurance policy to make sure the account holders get paid.  In the US, this is what the FDIC is for.  Worst case, the bank goes under, but your money is safe. These protections have worked pretty well for many decades.  However, during the recent financial crisis, all three of these protections were under heavy strain.  So, one of the things banking regulators did was to put the major banks through stress tests to make sure they could handle several bad financial events without collapsing.  These tests showed that some banks didn't have enough money in reserve.  (Not long after, banks started to increase fees and credit card rates to raise this additional capital.) Keep in mind that if banks were unable to use the deposited money (loan it out, invest it, etc), the current financial landscape would change considerably.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  While it's technically feasible for a bank to reach bankruptcy due to a cash rush, and poor lending choices may worsen the situation, this is uncommon. Keep in mind that banks have a sizeable customer base constantly depositing cash and remitting mortgage payments. This ordinarily suffices to manage the usual banking withdrawal activities, irrespective of any bad loans. Using historical statistics and risk stratagem, banks forecast the average cash withdrawals and determine the chances of loan defaults. This information is used to balance profitable ventures such as loan issuance and meeting account holder demands. In a drastic withdrawal scenario, safeguards are in place to prevent bankruptcy, like regulatory Reserve Requirements mandating the preservation of a specific amount of cash to prevent excessive risky lending. This requirement can be varied based on current economic conditions. If a bank faces difficulties, it has the option of a short term loan from another bank or the central bank such as the US Federal Reserve. Frequent borrowing will lead to an adjustment in their cash reserves. If worst comes to worst and the bank is unable to fulfil its commitments (for example, the Federal loan doesn't come through), there is an insurance policy to make certain that the account holders are compensated. In the US, the FDIC serves this purpose. In the worst-case scenario, if the bank fails, your investment is secure. These measures have been successful for many years. However, during the recent economic crisis, they were severely strained. As a response, banking regulators underwent stress tests on major banks to ensure their resilience to numerous financial adversities. Results indicated insufficiency in reserves for some banks. Consequently, banks started increasing fees and credit card rates for additional capital. Remember, if banks can't use the deposited funds for loans or investments, the financial picture would drastically morph.\n",

Picture buying sequence of 40 units of stock A at varying prices of $1, $4, $10 and $15 – each time purchasing 10 units, in such a situation, the IRS is interested in identifying which specific stock I put up for sale. Further, when I relocate stocks into another account, the cost basis is moved along with them. Cost basis is inherent in such transfers, dispelling uncertainty about which stock is up for sale in the original account. Referring to the scenario above, the cost basis concerning the 20 stocks relocated to a fresh account would likely be $1 x 10 and $4 x 10, meaning the rule of First In, First Out (FIFO) is applicable to transfers too. However, it could also be that a De Lorean car was involved in the stock transfer, which is not mentioned in the original text.\n",

Furthermore, there is a strong chance that people running the company also have stock, so it personally benefits them to create higher prices. Finally, maybe they don't care about the prices directly, but by being a good company with a good product or service, they are desirable and that is expressed as a higher stock price.  Not every action is because it will raise the stock price, but because it is good for business which happens to make the stock more valuable.\n",

Nevertheless, perhaps their focus isn't squarely on prices, yet through offering a quality product or service and being a reputable company, they become more appealing—this desirability often translates into a boosted share price.

      "Reference Response:  If you need less than $125k for the downpayment, I recommend you convert your mutual fund shares to their ETF counterparts tax-free: Can I convert conventional Vanguard mutual fund shares to Vanguard   ETFs? Shareholders of Vanguard stock index funds that offer Vanguard ETFs   may convert their conventional shares to Vanguard ETFs of the same   fund. This conversion is generally tax-free, although some brokerage   firms may be unable to convert fractional shares, which could result   in a modest taxable gain. (Four of our bond ETFs—Total Bond Market,   Short-Term Bond, Intermediate-Term Bond, and Long-Term Bond—do not   allow the conversion of bond index fund shares to bond ETF shares of   the same fund; the other eight Vanguard bond ETFs allow conversions.) There is no fee for Vanguard Brokerage clients to convert conventional   shares to Vanguard ETFs of the same fund. Other brokerage providers   may charge a fee for this service. For more information, contact your   brokerage firm, or call 866-499-8473. Once you convert from conventional shares to Vanguard ETFs, you cannot   convert back to conventional shares. Also, conventional shares held   through a 401(k) account cannot be converted to Vanguard ETFs. https://personal.vanguard.com/us/content/Funds/FundsVIPERWhatAreVIPERSharesJSP.jsp Withdraw the money you need as a margin loan, buy the house, get a second mortgage of $125k, take the proceeds from the second mortgage and pay back the margin loan. Even if you have short term credit funds, it'd still be wiser to lever up the house completely as long as you're not overpaying or in a bubble area, considering your ample personal investments and the combined rate of return of the house and the funds exceeding the mortgage interest rate.  Also, mortgage interest is tax deductible while margin interest isn't, pushing the net return even higher. $125k Generally, I recommend this figure to you because the biggest S&P collapse since the recession took off about 50% from the top.  If you borrow $125k on margin, and the total value of the funds drop 50%, you shouldn't suffer margin calls. I assumed that you were more or less invested in the S&P on average (as most modern \"asset allocations\" basically recommend a back-door S&P as a mix of credit assets, managed futures, and small caps average the S&P). Second mortgage Yes, you will have two loans that you're paying interest on. You've traded having less invested in securities & a capital gains tax bill for more liabilities, interest payments, interest deductions, more invested in securities, a higher combined rate of return. If you have $500k set aside in securities and want $500k in real estate, this is more than safe for you as you will most likely have a combined rate of return of ~5% on $500k with interest on $500k at ~3.5%.  If you're in small cap value, you'll probably be grossing ~15% on $500k. You definitely need to secure your labor income with supplementary insurance.  Start a new question if you need a model for that. Secure real estate with securities A local bank would be more likely to do this than a major one, but if you secure the house with the investment account with special provisions like giving them copies of your monthly statements, etc, you might even get a lower rate on your mortgage considering how over-secured the loan would be. You might even be able to wrap it up without a down payment in one loan if it's still legal.  Mortgage regulations have changed a lot since the housing crash.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  If you're considering a down payment less than $125k, it's advised that you transform your mutual fund shares to their ETF equivalents with no taxable implications: Would it be possible to transform traditional Vanguard mutual fund shares into Vanguard ETFs? Owners of Vanguard's stock index funds providing Vanguard ETFs have a chance to transform their original shares into Vanguard ETFs of the identical fund, commonly exempt from tax. Some brokerages might struggle to transform fractional shares, possibly leading to a minor taxable profit. (We have four bond ETFs—Total Bond Market, Short-Term Bond, Intermediate-Term Bond, and Long-Term Bond—that refrain from permitting the conversion of bond index fund shares into ETF shares of the same bond; but, we allow conversion in our eight remaining Vanguard bond ETFs.) Vanguard brokerage customers are not charged for turning regular shares into Vanguard ETFs of the same kind. Yet, some other brokerage firms may impose a service fee. Reach out to your brokerage company, or dial 866-499-8473 for further details. Post your shift from original shares to Vanguard ETFs, reconverting back to the original shares is disallowed. Likewise, ETF conversions are not applicable on original shares kept within a 401(k) account. https://personal.vanguard.com/us/content/Funds/FundsVIPERWhatAreVIPERSharesJSP.jsp. Proceed with withdrawing required funds as a margin loan to secure the property, then acquire a second mortgage of $125k to pay back the margin loan. Even when having short term credit funds, it remains prudent to leverage the property as long as you're not investing excessively or within an inflation-prone area, given your satisfactory personal investments and the blended return of the house and funds outpacing mortgage interest. Moreover, tax deductibility is enabled for mortgage interest while it is restricted on margin interest, pushing the net return even more. A rounded figure of $125k is recommended given the worst S&P downfall since the recession, which resulted in a significant 50% decrease from its peak value. A margin loan of $125k seems safe considering a scenario where the total-value funds drop by 50%, ensuring you're safeguarded from a margin call. I made an assumption that you'd have largely invested into the S&P based on contemporary \"asset allocations\" essentially prescribing a hidden S&P as a composition of credit assets, guided futures, and small caps an average to the S&P. It's vital to understand that you'll be manning two loans and paying interest on both. The benefit is a traded state where you'll be yielding less from securities & dealing with a capital gains tax, but attaining more liabilities, interest payments, interest deductions, a higher investment in securities, enhanced return rate. If you possess $500k saved in securities, wanting another $500k in real estate seems pretty safe assuming a probable combined return of ~5% on $500k besides interest on $500k at roughly ~3.5%. A higher gross of ~15% on $500k is likely if you're in a small cap value. You must assuredly protect your work income with supplemental insurance. Reach out if you require a model for this. Providing securities will secure the real estate. A local bank is more likely to accept than a larger-scale one. If you safeguard the property with the investment account with perquisites like regular updates of your monthly statements, a lower rate of interest on your property mortgage may be achievable due to the over-secured loan. Unable to make a down payment in one loan may no longer be legal since dramatic alterations in mortgage regulations following the housing crash.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The best strategy? Skip the loan. Find a way to invest for a low starting amount via a retirement account (such as a 401K or IRA in the United States) or non-retirement account. Use this money to buy individual stocks or funds. Every month put money from your regular income into this investment account. Then buy more stocks or sell if the conditions change based on what the market is doing, not to meet a loan payment. This helps you because if the price fluctuates you will buy more shares if the price is down; and you will buy fewer shares when the price is up. It also allows you to skip worrying about how to repay the loan. It also means that you not have to pull more money out of savings to make the final loan payments if it doesn't make as much money as you plan. Regarding your math. This is a better understanding of the money flow than the earlier question.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Consider avoiding borrowing money. Explore options to kickstart your investment with a minimal initial amount through a retirement or non-retirement account such as a 401K or IRA in the U.S.. This cash can then be utilized to purchase individual stocks or mutual funds. Regularly contribute to this account from your monthly earnings. Continue buying more stocks or sell some based on market movements, not to cover a debt repayment. Such a method benefits you as it allows you to acquire more equity when prices are low and lesser when prices climb. Additionally, you can save yourself the stress over loan reimbursements. You also won't have to dip into your savings to cover the final loan payments if your investments don't yield the expected returns. As for your mathematical calculations, this approach provides a clearer perspective of cash flow compared to your initial inquiry.

      "Reference Response:  The answer probably varies with local law, and you haven't said where you're located. In most or all US states, it appears that after some statutory length of time, the bank would transfer the money to the state government, where it would be held indefinitely as \"unclaimed property\" in the name of the recipient (technically, the payee, the person to whom the check is made payable).  This process is called escheatment.  Most states publish a list of all unclaimed property, so at some later date the payee could find their name on this list, and realize they were entitled to the funds.  There would then be a process by which the payee could claim the funds from the state.   Usually the state keeps any interest earned on the money. As far as I know, there typically wouldn't be any way for you, the person who originated the payment, to collect the money after escheatment.  (Before escheatment, if you have the uncashed check in your possession, you can usually return it to the bank and have it refunded to you.) I had trouble finding an authoritative source explaining this, but a number of informal sources (found by Googling \"cashier check escheatment\") seem to agree that this is generally how it works.  Here is the web site for a law firm, saying that in California an uncashed cashier's check escheats to the state after 3 years. Until escheatment occurs, the recipient can cash the check at any time.  I don't think that cashier's checks become \"stale\" like personal checks do, and there isn't any situation in which the funds would automatically revert to you.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The interpretation might differ according to local rules, and you haven't indicated your whereabouts. In the majority, if not all, of U.S regions, it's likely that after a designated period, the bank may forward your money to the local government, where it's stored permanently as \"unretrieved assets\" under the recipient's name (formally, the payee, the individual to whom the cheque is addressed). This procedure is referred to as escheatment. Almost all regions make public a list containing all unretrieved assets, thus enabling the payee to identify their name on this registry, and recognize their rights to the funds. They'll then have a medium of obtaining these funds from the state. Typically, all interest gained on the money is taken by the state. To the best of my comprehension, there’s unlikely to be an option for you, the originator of the payment, to recover the cash after escheatment. (Before escheatment, if the uncashed cheque is with you, it's often possible to take it back to the bank and ask for a refund.) Locating a formal source to explain this was challenging, although numerous casual sources (unearthed by an Internet search of \"cashier check escheatment\") appear to reach a consensus on this. Introducing the web address for a law agency, uncashed cashier checks in California become escheated to the state after a duration of 3 years. The recipient has the privilege to cash the cheque at any moment before escheatment occurs. I doubt that cashier's checks turn \"stale\" similar to personal checks, nor is there any circumstance where the funds would automatically return to you.\n",

      "Reference Response:  If the business is being investigated by your state's Attorney General's office, then your first call should be to that office.  They will be able to help you in a few ways, even if they can't explicitly resolve the situation, and they also would undoubtedly appreciate your information to add to their case as well. First, they may be able to tell you how other victims have had their cases resolved, particularly if any went to court on their own.  While they won't be able to provide you with personal information of the other victims unless it is public knowledge (via a court case), the information about how the other victims resolved the cases may be helpful - both to show what to do, and what not to do. Second, they may be able to put you in contact with an attorney who is handling other cases like yours. That may reduce the cost of the attorney (as they'll have already done some of the work), and may mean that the attorney is willing to work with no up front fee on the assumption of winning the case. Third, if there are options for getting your money back without a court case, the AG's office may be able to help provide those as well. If the Attorney General's office is unable to help you, then your best bet is to contact an attorney on your own - look for one who specializes in consumer protection and fraud.  This is the purpose attorneys exist for: pursuing your interests against another's.  Let them do their job.  Do make an effort to find a good, honest attorney; you may find some help on how to do this on law.se if you need it (not actual recommendations, mind you, just help with how you would go about finding one).  It sounds like your claim would be above and beyond the level of a small claims court lawsuit, but verify this in your jurisdiction; if small claims court goes up to $10,000, you may be able to pursue it there on your own - but I would still get some help from an attorney, at least finding out what you would need to win.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  If the corporation you're investigating is under scrutiny from the Attorney General's office in your region, your initial point of contact should be with them. Even though they may not be able to fully rectify the predicament, they would certainly value any additional information you can offer. Firstly, they might offer insights into how previous victims successfully addressed their grievances, particularly those who pursued individual legal action. They won't disclose personal details of others unless it's public information but insights into how others managed their cases may guide you on the steps to follow and to avoid. Secondly, this office could possibly connect you with a lawyer managing similar cases, which could potentially lessen the legal fees and the attorney might even work under the prospect of a success fee arrangement. Thirdly, if possible, the office could guide you on obtaining a refund without going to court. If they're unable to assist, consider seeking out your own lawyer specializing in consumer rights and deception—after all, their job is to advocate for you. Always go for an ethical lawyer; you might find cues on how to go about this on law.se (without actual endorsements, but more of a guide on the process). Depending on your particular case and the jurisdiction you are in, it may be above the scope of what a small claims court can handle; in this case, getting a lawyer's guidance would be essential.\n",

      "Reference Response:  What is the best way that I can invest money so that I can always get   returns? If you want something that doesn't require any work on your end, consider having a fee-only financial planner make a plan so that your investments can be automated to generate a cash flow for you or get an annuity as the other classic choices here as most other choices will require some time commitment in one form or other. Note that for stock investments there could be rare instances like what happened for a week in September in 2001 where the markets were closed for 5 days straight that can be the hiccup in having stocks. Bonds can carry a risk of default where there have been municipalities that defaulted on debt as well as federal governments like Russia in the 1990s. Real estate may be subject to natural disasters or other market forces that may prevent there always being a monthly payment coming as if you own a rental property then what happens if there aren't tenants because there was an evacuation of the area? There may be some insurance products to cover some of these cases though what if there are exceptionally high claims all at once that may have an insurance company go under? Would it be to set up an FD in a bank, to buy land, to buy a rental   house, to buy a field, or maybe to purchase gold?  What investment of your own time do you plan on making here? Both in terms of understanding what your long-term strategy is and then the maintenance of the plan. If you put the money in the bank, are you expecting that the interest rate will always be high enough to give you sufficient cash to live as well as having no financial crisis with the bank or currency you are using? Are there any better investments? You may want to reconsider what assumptions you want to make and what risks you want to accept as there isn't likely to be a single solution here that would be perfect.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  What's the premier strategy for me to put my funds to work and ensure steady revenue? If you're looking for an option devoid of active participation, explore the idea of taking the advice of a fee-only financial advisor to tailor a plan for automated earnings, or perhaps invest in an annuity, as these often simpler routes demand less constant engagement in comparison to other alternatives. Be aware that investing in the stock market isn't devoid of risks as exhibited by the unprecedented event of market closure for five continuous days in September 2001. Bonds come with the potential risk of default as evidenced by municipalities and national governments like 90's Russia defaulting on their debts. Real estate could be potentially impacted by environmental tragedies or market dynamics preventing any guarantee of steady monthly income, especially in case of rental properties in evacuated areas due to said tragedies. Certain insurance options offer some safety net in the face of these possible circumstances, but one must consider the potentiality of insurance companies becoming bankrupt due to extremely high claim rates. Ponder on whether establishing a Fixed Deposit in a bank, purchasing land or a rental property, obtaining a field, or buying gold are the right courses of action for you. Have you thought about the time you plan to dedicate to this? Knowledge of your long-term strategy and the upkeep of said plan must be considered. If banking is your method of choice, can you bank on the interest rate remaining lucrative enough to support your lifestyle, specifically without any financial crisis impacting your bank or chosen currency taking place?

      "Reference Response:  I am from Australia, so my answer is based on my experience over here, however it should be similar for the USA. Generally, what determines both the price of houses/apartments and the rents for them is supply and demand. When there is high demand and low supply prices (or rents) generally go up. When there is low demand and high supply prices (or rents) usually go down. What can sometimes happen when house prices go down, is that the demand can drop but so can supply. As the prices drop, developers will make less money on building new houses, so stop building new houses. Other developers can go bankrupt. As less people (including investors) are buying houses, and more people (including investors) try to sell their existing houses, there will be more people looking to rent and less rental properties available to rent. This produces a perfect storm of high demand and low supply of rental properties, causing rents to rise strongly. When the property prices start to go up again as demand increases, there is a shortfall of new properties being built (due to the developers not building during the downturn). At this time developers start to build again but there is a lag time before the new houses can be completed. This lack of supply puts more pressure on both house prices and rents to go up further. Until equilibrium between supply and demand is realised or an oversupply of rental properties exists in the market, rents will continue to rise.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Coming from Europe, my viewpoint is predicated on my experiences in this region, yet it could be somewhat different in Canada. The main factors that influence the cost of homes and rentals are market congestion and consumer preferences. High consumer demand and low market availability typically elevate housing and rental prices. Conversely, low demand paired with a surge in available properties often leads to a decrease in prices. Occasionally, a decline in housing prices results not just in less consumer interest but also in contraction of available supplies. As prices plummet, builders earn less profit from new constructions prompting them to cease their projects. Some builders may even succumb to financial crisis. With fewer individuals (even investors) venturing into property buying and more people (including investors) trying to liquidate their properties, an influx of prospective tenants enter the market while ready-to-rent properties dwindle. This creates a scenario of rising rental prices due to the incredibly high demand and scarcity of rental units. When the cost of properties starts to rebound due to increase in demand, new constructions still lag behind because builders had halted their operations during the downturn. These property shortages put added strain on rental and housing costs to further increase. The rent would keep augmenting till balance is achieved between availability and consumer demand, or until there is an excess of rental properties in the market.\n",

      "Paraphrased Response:  This is what I would suggest; 1.3 million doesn't equate to retirement for life.

To establish SOME sort of stability, I'd recommend dividing your investments like so: 15% I would allocate to gold certificates and physical gold (stored safely). %25 I would invest in bitcoin (ensure you educate yourself if you're new to this). %35 I would put towards regular financial vehicles (stocks, options, bonds, forex). %30 I would keep in the bank to cover life's expenses, especially if you're planning on stopping work. 15% I'd funnel into startup companies, embracing the high risk for potentially high returns.

If you had no debt at all and enough financial assets to cover the cost, would you borrow money at [interest rate] to obtain a degree?  Put it in the housing way, if you paid off your home, would you pull out an equity loan/line for a purchase when you have enough money in savings?  I can't answer the question for you or anyone else, as you can probably find many people who will see benefits to either. I can tell you two observations I've made about this question (it comes a lot with housing) over time.  First, it tends to come up a lot when stocks are in a bubble to the point where people begin to consider borrowing from 0% interest rate credit cards to buy stocks (or float bills for a while).  How quickly people forget what it feels (and looks like) when you see your financial assets drop 50-60%!  It's not Wall Street that's greedy, it's most average investors.  Second, people asking this question generally overlook the behavior behind the action; as Carnegie said, \"Concentration is the key to wealth\" and concentrating your financial energy on something, instead of throwing it all over the place, can simplify your life.  This is one reason why lottery winners don't keep their winnings: their financial behavior was rotten before winning, and simply getting a lot of money seldom changes behavior.  Even if you get paid a lot or little, that's irrelevant to success because success requires behavior and when you master the behavior everything else (like money, happiness, peace of mind, etc) follows.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Approaching this discussion, I reflect on Dave Ramsey's reasoning, for it's a heated topic whenever one discusses early debt clearance. Reflect on this tweet: student loans may be debt to you, but they are assets for the government. If you were free of all debts and possessed ample financial assets, would you choose to loan money at a certain interest rate just for a degree? From a housing perspective, if you've fully paid your house, would you take out a mortgage for a purchase when you have sufficient savings? I may not be able to answer this for you or anyone else as different people may find different benefits. Still, I can share some insights from my experiences with this topic, which comes up frequently in housing contexts. Firstly, it often surfaces when stocks are inflated to the extent that people start contemplating using 0% interest rate credit cards for stock purchases (or even covering bills). It's startling how quickly individuals forget the sting and sight of their financial assets plummeting by 50-60%. The greed isn't on Wall Street, but resides within the typical investors. Secondly, those who pose this question usually ignore the motives behind the action. According to Carnegie, \"Concentration is the key to wealth,\" and focusing your financial energy can simplify your life. This could explain why lottery winners often squander their winnings: their financial habits were poor before their win, and a sudden influx of money seldom alters behavior. No matter how much or how little you earn, it's irrelevant to success. True success comes with mastering the right behavior, and with this, everything else follows, such as money, happiness, peace of mind, etc.\n",

      "Reference Response:  If this money is intended to be used for retirement and depending on how old \"older\" is, it sounds a little risky to be putting too much money in a stock based mutual fund.  While the CDs may seem like crappy investments right now, it is important to down-shift risk as you get closer to retirement because this person won't have as much time to recover if the markets take another big dip.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Investing a substantial amount of money in a stock-driven mutual fund might come off as hazardous, especially if the term \"older\" denotes advanced age and this fund is meant for retirement purposes. Admittedly, Certificates of Deposit may not appear to be lucrative at the moment, but as one approaches retirement, diminishing risk becomes crucial.

      "Reference Response:  I completely agree with Pete that a 401(k) loan is not the answer, but I have an alternate proposal: Reduce your 401(k) contribution down to the 4% that you get a match on.  If you are cash poor now and have debts to be cleaned up, those need to be addressed before retirement savings.  You'll have plenty of time to make up the lost savings after you get the debts paid off.   If your company matches 50% (meaning you have to contribute 8% to get the 4% match), then consider temporarily stopping your 401(k) altogether. A 100% match is very hard to give up, but a 50% match is less difficult.  You have plenty of years left ahead of you to make up the lost match.  Plus, the pain of knowing you're leaving money on the table will incentivize you to get the loans paid as quickly as possible.  It seems to me that I would be reducing middle to high interest debt while also saving myself $150 per month.  No, you'd be deferring $150 per month for an additional two years, and not reducing debt at all, just moving it to a different lender. Interest rate is not your problem.  Right now you're paying less than $30 per month in interest on these 3 loans and about $270 in principal, and at the current rate should have them paid off in about 2 years.  You're wanting to extend these loans to 4 years by borrowing from your retirement savings.   I would buckle down, reduce expenses wherever possible (cable? cell phone? coffee? movies? restaurants?) until you get these debts paid off.  You make $70,000 per year, or almost $6,000 per month.  I bet if you try hard enough you can come up with $1,100 fairly quickly. Then the next $1,200 should come twice as fast. Then attack the next $4,000. (You can argue whether the $1,200 should come first because of the interest rate, but in the end it doesn't matter - either one should be paid off very quickly, so the interest saved is negligible) Maybe you can get one of them paid off, get yourself some breathing room, then loosen up a little bit, but extending the pain for an additional two years is not wise. Some more drastic measures:\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Pete's viewpoint that obtaining a 401(k) loan isn't the ideal solution aligns perfectly with my own. However, I do propose another approach to consider: reduce your 401(k) contribution to the qualifying 4% that is matched by your company. If your current fiscal standing showcases limited cash reserves coupled with debts requiring resolution, solving those issues should be your priority, leaving risk preparation for retirement taking a secondary role. The squandered savings could be made up post clearing your debts. Should your employer match only half (demanding an 8% contribution to acquire a 4% match), entertain the thought of suspending your 401(k) contributions completely, albeit this might not be an easy decision especially when 100% match is at stake. Yet the thought of missing out on money could spearhead an expedited loan clearance, oddly enough serving as a positive reinforcement. In my assessments, it appears as though your monthly outflow could decline by around $150 through this approach. However, this isn't exactly trimming your financial burden; it merely moves your debt to different recipient and lengthens your payment period by an additional two years. The real issue isn't your interest rate. The current breakdown of your loans indicates close to $30/month towards interest and approximately $270 on principal. Anticipating the similar pace of payment, these loans could be settled within two years. Extending your loan term by utilizing your retirement savings isn't wise. On the other hand, guided expenditure reductions could help considerably. You're currently making around $70,000 a year, which translates to nearly $6,000 monthly. With determined effort, you should be able to mobilize an amount around $1,100 fairly swiftly, followed by doubling that up for the next loan you need to tackle. Once you've cleared your slate of one of the loans, you might acquire enough leeway to adjust your lifestyle slightly. But lengthening your discomfort by sticking to the existing plan for two more years isn't recommended. Some additional rigorous steps could also be explored.\n",

      "Reference Response:  This answer is specifically for the UK, but one building society has an account set up specifically for this. You actually refer your friend/family member to set up an account and then it can be linked to your mortgage. They don't get any interest for their account as it's all offset against your mortgage. If you then happen to give them a cash gift (up to £250 or possibly £3000 per year, I can't work out which is the reliable number, as of 2015) then it's all completely above board.\n",

You can recommend your acquaintance or relative to establish an account which can then be intertwined with your home loan.

If by chance you choose to present them with a monetary endowment (either up to £250 or possibly £3000 yearly, a solid figure is tough to ascertain, as of 2015), then everything is perfectly legitimate.

      "Reference Response:  A derivative is a financial instrument of a special kind, the kind “whose price depends on, or is derived from, another asset”.  This definition is from John Hull, Options, Futures and Other Derivatives – a book definitely worth to own if you are curious about this, you can easily find old copies for a few dollars. The first point is that a derivative is a financial instrument, like credits, or insurances, the second point is that its price depends closely from the price of something else, the mentioned asset. In most cases derivatives can be understood as financial insurances against some risk bound to the asset. In the sequel I give a small list of derivatives and highlight the assets and the risk they can be bound to.  And first, let me point out that the definition is (marginally) wrong because some derivatives depend on things which are not assets, nor do they have a price, like temperature, sunlight, or even your own life in the case of mortgages.  But before going in this list, let me go through the remaining points of your question. What is the basic idea and concept behind a derivative? As already noted, in most cases, a derivative can be understood as a financial insurance compensating from a risk of some sort.  In a classical insurance contract, one party of the contract is an insurance company, but in the broader case of a derivative, that counterparty can be pretty anything: an insurance, a bank, a government, a large company, and most probably market makers. How is it really used, and how does this deviate from the first point? Briefly, how does is it affecting people, and how is it causing problems? An important point with derivatives is that it can be arbitrarily complicated to compute their prices.  Actually what is hidden in the attempt of giving a definition for derivatives, is that they are products whose price Y is a measurable function of one or several random variables X_1, X_2, … X_n on which we can use the theory of arbitrage pricing to get hints on the actual price Y of the asset – this is what the depends on means in technical terms.  In the most favorable case, we obtain an easy formula linking Y to the X_is which tells us what is the price of our financial instrument. But in practice, it can be very difficult, if at all possible, to determine a price for derivatives. This has two implications: Persons possessing sophisticated techniques to compute the price of derivatives have a strategic advantage on derivatives market, in comparison to less advanced actors on the market. Organisation owning assets they cannot price cannot compute their bilan anymore, so that they cannot know for sure their financial situation. They are somehow playing roulette. But wait, if derivatives are insurances they should help to mitigate some financial risk, which precisely means that they should help their owners to more accurately see their financial situation! How is this not a contradiction? Some persons with sophisticated techniques to compute the price of derivatives are actually selling complicated derivatives to less knowledgeable persons.  For instance, many communes in France and Germany have contracted credits whose reimbursements have a fixed interest part, like in a classical credit, and a variable interest part whose rate is computed against a complicated formula involving the value of the Swiss frank at each quarter starting from the inception of the credit.  (So, for a 25 years running credit of theis type, the price Y of the credit at its inception depends on 100 Xs, which are the uncertain prices for the Swiss frank each quarter of the 25 next years.)  Some of these communes can be quite small, with 5.000 inhabitants, and needless to say, do not have the required expertise to analyse the risks bound to such instruments, which in that special case led the court call the credit a swindling and to cancel the credit.  But what chain of events leads a 5.000 inhabitants city in France to own a credit whose reimbursements depends on the Swiss frank?  After the credit crunch in 2007 and the fall of Lehman Brothers in 2008, it has begun to be very hard to organise funding, which basically means to conclude credits running long in time on large amounts of money.  So, the municipality needs a 25 years credit of 10.000.000 EUROS and goes to its communal bank.  The communal bank has hundreds or thousands of municipalities looking for credits and needs itself a financing.  So the communal bank goes to one of the five largest financial institutions in the world, which insists on selling a huge credit whose reimbursements have a variable part depending on hundred of values the Swiss frank will have in the 25 next years. Since the the big bank has better computation techniques than the small bank it makes a big profit.  Since the small bank has no idea, how to compute the correct price of the credit it bought, it cuts this in pieces and sell it in the same form to the various communes it works with.  If we were to attribute this kind of intentions to the largest five banks, we could ask about the possibility that they designed the credit to take advantage of the primitive evaluation methods of the small bank. We could also ask if they organised a cartel to force communal banks to buy their bermudean snowballs. And we could also ask, if they are so influent that they eventually can manipulate the Swiss frank to secure an even higher profit.  But I will not go into this.  To the best of my understanding, the subprime crisis is a play along the same plot, with different actors, but I know this latter subject only by what I could read in French newspapers. So much for the “How is it causing problems?” part. What is some of the terminology in relation to derivatives (and   there meanings of course)? Answering this question is basically the purpose of the 7 first chapters of the book by Hull, along with deriving some important mathematical principles.  And I will not copy these seven chapters here! How would someone get started dealing in derivatives (I'm playing a     realistic stock market simulation, so it doesn't matter if your     answer to this costs me money)? If you ask the question, I understand that you are not a professional, so that your are actually trying to become the one that has money and zero knowledge in the play I outlined above. I would recommand not doing this.  That said, if you have a good mathematical background and can program well, once you are confindent with the books of Hull and Joshi, you can have fun implementing various market models and implementing trading strategies. Once you are confident with this, you can also read the articles on quantitative finance on arXiv.org. And once you are done with this, you can decide for yourself if you want to play the same market as the guys writing these articles. (And yes, even for the simplest options, they have better models than you have and will systematically outperform you in the long run, even if some random successes will give you the feeling that you do well and could do better.) (indeed, I've made it a personal goal to somehow lose every last cent of my money) You know your weapons! :) Two parties agree today on a price for one to deliver a commodity to the other at some future instant.  This is a classical future contract, it can be modified in every imaginable way, usually by embedding options.  For instance one party could have the option to choose between different delivery points or delivery days. Two parties write today a contract allowing the one party to buy at some future time a commodity to the the second party.  The price is written today, as part of the contract.  (There is the corresponding option entitling the owner to sell something.)  Unlike the future contract, only one party can be obliged to do something, the other jas a right but no obligation. If you buy and option, your are buying some sort of insurance against a change of price on some asset. This is the most familiar to anybody.  Credits can come in many different flavours, especially the formula to compute interests, or also embed options.  Common options are early settlement options or restructuration options. While this is not completely inutitive, the credit works like an insurance.  This is most easily understood from the side of the organisation lending the money, that speculates that the ratio of creanciers going bankrupt will be low enough for her to make profit, just like a fire insurance company speculates that the ratio of fire accidents will be low enough for her to make a profit. This is like a mortgage on a financial institution.  Two parties agree that one will recive an upfront today and give a compensation to the second one if some third party defaults. Here this is an explicit insurance against the unfortuante event, where a creancier goes bankrupt. One finds here more or less standard options on electricity. But electricity have delicious particularities as it can practically not be stored, and fallout is also (usually) avoided. As for classical options, these are insurances against price moves. A swap is like two complementary credits on the same amount of money, so that it ends up in the two parties not actually exchanging the credit nominal and only paying interest one to the other — which makes only sense if these interests are computed with different formulas. Typical example are fixed rate vs. EURIBOR on some given maturity, which we interpret as an insurance against fluctuations of the EURIBOR, or a fixed rate vs. the exchange ratio between two currencies, which we interpret as an insurance against the two currencies decorrelating. Swaps are the richest and the most generic category of financial derivatives.  The off-the-counter market features very imaginative, very customised insurance products. The most basic form is the insurance against drought, but you can image different dangers, and once you have it you can put it in options, in a swap, etc.  For instance, a restaurant with a terrasse could enter in a weather insurance, paying each year a fixed amount of money and becoming in return an amount of money based on the amount of rainy day in a year. Actually, this list is virtually without limits!\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  A derivative is a unique financial tool whose value correlates with another capital. According to John Hull, author of Options, Futures and Other Derivatives, a book he highly recommends for those interested in this field, derivatives fall under the category of financial instruments much like credits and insurance. Its price relies heavily on the fluctuation of the value of a secondary asset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, derivatives serve as a financial safeguard against potential risks associated with the asset in question. I'll provide a brief overview of various derivatives and the assets and risks that may apply. It should be noted that this explanation isn't fully accurate since some derivatives depend on non-asset factors without explicit price-tags like weather conditions, sunlight intensity, or personal situations such as life insurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, shall we examine the underpinning idea of a derivative? Typically, a derivative operates much like a financial coverage against any risk. In traditional insurance contracts, the insurance company serves as one of the parties. However, in derivatives contracts, the other party could be anyone- be it insurance, a bank, a government, a huge corporation, or most likely, market makers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's delve into the application and possible disparities from its original goal. Does this instrument affect the general population, and if so, how does it cause problems?\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting the complexity that often comes with pricing derivatives. An attempt at defining derivatives unveils the fact that they are valued objects whose price, Y, is calculable through the application of arbitrage theory on one or more random variables X_1, X_2, … X_n. Put simply, this explains the technical meaning of \"depends on\" as it pertains to derivatives. Sometimes, it can be straightforward to derive a formula connecting Y with the X variables, which states the cost of our financial tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in reality, pricing derivatives can be an uphill task, leading to two significant consequences: Individuals or groups with the know-how to price derivatives gain a competitive edge in the market. Also, organizations possessing assets that they struggle to price jeopardize their financial situation as they are blindly gambling.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, shouldn't derivatives, being insurance, mitigate financial risks enabling owners to better understand their financial situations? The paradox comes into play when individuals who can accurately price derivatives sell sophisticated derivatives to others lacking adequate knowledge about them. \n",
      "\n",
      "This explanation is not exhaustive, and getting into the nitty-gritty of derivatives involves delving into extensive terminologies whose understanding is the primary objective of John Hull's book's first seven chapters. \n",

      "If you wish to venture into the world of derivatives without a professional background, I'd advise against it.

Be forewarned though, the market players writing articles on quantitative finance on arXiv.org are well-versed in the simplest options and will consistently outperform you. Regardless of occasional wins that offer validation, remember they have superior models and will maintain an upper hand in the long run.\n",

      "Reference Response:  grant date or vesting date?\n",
      "A: For restricted stock, I think the vesting date meets the requirements of the second wash sale trigger from IRS Pub 550: Wash Sales: Acquire substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade I base this on these two quotes from IRS Pub 525: Restricted Property: any income from the property, or the right to use the property, is included in your income as additional compensation in the year you receive the income or have the right to use the property. - Until the property becomes substantially vested, it is owned by the person who makes the transfer to you, usually your employer.  So on the vest date: The transfer is taxable Ownership is transferred to you That seems close enough to \"a fully taxable trade\" for me.  Maybe this changes if you pay the tax on the stock on the grant date. See Pub 525: Restricted Property: Choosing to include in income for year of transfer. Obviously, if this is important you should consult your tax advisor.  Technicalities aside, I don't think it passes the sniff test. You're getting salable shares when the restricted stock vests. If you're selling other shares at a loss within 30 days of the vesting date, that smells like a wash sale to me.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Given the limitations linked to restricted shares, I deduce that the substantive qualification date satisfies the second measure of the IRS Publication 550's wash sale: procuring equal assets or shares in a fully accountable market. This finding is based on these couple of excerpts from the IRS Publication 525 related to Restricted Assets: any earnings derived from the asset, or the permission to employ the asset, is factored into your annual income as supplementary compensation in the calendar year you acquire the earnings or gain the right to use the asset - Before the asset obtains substantive qualification, the individual conducting the transfer to you, generally your employer, owns it. Hence on the date of qualification: The change of hands is taxable and you acquire ownership. This appears to align rather closely with \"a complete taxable exchange\" for my liking. It might vary if the taxation on the shares is done on the given date. Refer to Publication 525: Restricted Assets: Opting to include it in the income for the year of transfer. It is prudent to seek advice from your tax advisor if this is essential. Ignoring the finer details, I have my reservations. When the restricted shares are vested, you're getting sellable shares. If you're disposing of other shares at a loss within a timeframe of 30 days from the vesting date, it gives off the impression of a wash sale.\n",

Is it neccessarry to pay them to have an LLC or I can do that myself? No, you can do it yourself. The $49 is for your convenience, but there's nothing they can do that you wouldn't be able to do on your own. What I need to know and what I need to do before forming an LLC? You need to know that LLC is a legal structure that is designed to provide legal protections. As such, it is prudent to talk to a legal adviser, i.e.: a Virginia-licensed attorney. Is it possible if I hire some employees who living in India? Is the salary for my employees a expense? Do I need to claim this expense? This, I guess, is entirely unrelated to your questions about LLC. Yes, it is possible. The salary you pay your employees is your expense. You need to claim it, otherwise you'd be inflating your earnings which in certain circumstances may constitute fraud. What I need to do to protect my company? For physical protection, you'd probably hire a security guard. If you're talking about legal protections, then again - talk to a lawyer. What can I do to reduce taxes? Vote for a politician that promises to reduce taxes. Most of them never deliver though. Otherwise you can do what everyone else is doing - tax planning.

What I need to know after forming an LLC? You'll need to learn what are the filing requirements in your State (annual reports, tax reports, business taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes, etc). Most are the same for same proprietors and LLCs, so you probably will not be adding to much extra red-tape. Your attorney and tax adviser will help you with this, but you can also research yourself on the Virginia department of corporations/State department (whichever deals with LLCs).\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I comprehend that numerous services over the web offer assistance in setting up an LLC online, sometimes as little as $49. Is it a condition to use these services for obtaining an LLC or could I opt to go it alone? Actually, it's perfectly doable on your part. That $49 serves primarily as a convenience charge; there's really nothing these services do that you weren't capable of doing solo. What should I learn and undertake before creating an LLC? Understanding that an LLC is a legal establishment intended to offer legal safeguards is paramount. Therefore, it's wise to consult a legal expert, such as an attorney licensed in Virginia. Can I employ people who reside in India? Is the wage for these employees considered an expense? Do I need to declare this expense? Although unrelated to your LLC queries, yes, you certainly can. The compensation you offer your employees is an outlay from your end. You're obligated to declare it, or else you risk overestimating your revenue, which could lead to charges of fraud under certain instances. What's required from me to secure my business? For material security, employing a security guard might be beneficial. However, if legal cover is what you're referring to, consultation with a legal professional is advised again. What action can I take to lessen my taxes? You could cast your vote for a candidate pledging to cut taxes. However, typically, they fail to fulfil these promises. Alternatively, you could emulate what the masses resort to - tax planning. It involves thoughtful foresight of your expenditures, timing your bills and capitalizing on tax deferment schemes, etc. A sit-down with your tax consultant, preferably an EA or a CPA operating out of Virginia, should prove insightful. After setting up an LLC, what should be my next course of action? You should be well versed with your State's filing requisites (annual declarations, tax documents, business taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes, etc). As both proprietors and LLCS face similar requirements, you won't have to deal with extra bureaucracy. Your attorney and tax consultant should assist you with the same, though you could conduct your own research amongst the Virginia department of corporations/State department (the department that handles LLC related issues).\n",

      "Reference Response:  This is a reasonable question about inflation.  I would just like to note that inflation is nearly zero at the moment.  And interest rates are very low.  For a stable enterprise, borrowing cash is very easy right now.  Naturally, things could change in a year.  But the reason a company like Microsoft (but not just them) might hoard cash right now is that it gives them weight for buying up smaller firms, muscling rivals, and signaling their comfort level with the way things look for them.  It could also be because they are out of ideas for what to invest in, and/or are waiting for conditions to change before making any big decisions.  But with an interest rate at close to zero, and an inflation rate at close to zero, at the moment, inflation is not going to be a consideration in evaluating such a company.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Contemplating inflation related matters remains a credible query. However, one should not overlook the fact that inflation is almost non-existent at this point. Concurrently, interest rates are at an all-time low. So, loaning funds comes with little complications for a steadfast business in present times. Obviously, the scenario could alter within the span of a year. Although the rationale behind a corporation like Microsoft (though they're not the only one) stashing away money may be to use it as leverage when acquiring smaller businesses, overpowering competitors, and expressing their confidence in the current status quo. A lack of innovative investment concepts or a wait-and-watch approach before taking significant steps could also be probable causes. Nevertheless, with nearly zero interest and inflation rates currently, the possibility of inflation influencing such company assessments remains somewhat unimportant.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I think you may be drawing the wrong conclusion about why you put what type of investment in a taxable vs. tax-advantaged account. It is not so much about risk, but type of return. If you're investing both tax-advantaged and taxable accounts, you can benefit by putting more tax-inefficient investments inside your tax-advantaged accounts. Some aggressive asset types, like real estate, can throw off a lot of taxable income. If your asset allocation calls for investing in real estate, holding it in a 401k or IRA can allow more of your money to remain invested, rather than having to use it to pay for taxes. And if you're holding in a Roth IRA, you get that tax free. But bonds, a decidedly non-aggressive asset, also throw off a lot of taxable income. You're able to hold them in a tax-advantaged account and not pay taxes on the income until you withdraw it from the account (or tax free in the case of a Roth account.) An aggressive stock fund that is primarily expected to provide returns via price appreciation would do well in a taxable account because there's likely little tax consequence to you until it is sold.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I believe you're potentially misunderstanding the reasoning behind the selection of investment types for taxable and tax-favored accounts. It's less about hazard and more about the nature of returns. Placing tax-inefficient investments into your tax-favored accounts can prove beneficial for those diversifying their assets across both taxable and tax-advantaged accounts. Riskier asset classes like real estate tend to generate considerable taxable income. If your investment strategy includes real estate, storing it in an IRA or 401k could help preserve your funds for investment, instead of being utilized for tax payments. Moreover, if these assets are housed in a Roth IRA, the returns are tax exempt. In contrast, bonds, despite being less risky, yet produce substantial taxable income. Keeping them in a tax-favored account allows you to defer paying taxes on income until you decide to withdraw it from the account (or if it's in a Roth account, you won't have to pay tax at all). Aggressively investing in a stock fund, where profits mostly come from an increase in share price, is suitable for a taxable account as the tax impacts will only occur when you decide to sell. \n",

      "Reference Response:  As @ApplePie pointed out in their answer, at any given time there is a finite amount of stock available in a company. One subtlety you may be missing is that there is always a price associated with an offer to buy shares. That is, you don't put in an order simply to buy 1 share of ABC, you put in an order to buy 1 share of ABC for $10. If no one is willing to sell a share of ABC for $10, then your order will go unfilled. This happens millions of times a day as traders try to figure the cheapest price they can get for a stock. Practically speaking, there is always a price at which people are willing to sell their shares. You can put in a market order for 1 share of ABC, which says essentially \"I want one share of ABC, and I will pay whatever the market deems to be the price\". Your broker will find you 1 share, but you may be very unhappy about the price you have to pay! While it's very rare for a market to have nobody willing to sell at any price, it occasionally happens that no one is willing to buy at any price. This causes a market crash, as in the 2007-2008 financial crisis, when suddenly everyone became very suspicious of how much debt the major banks actually held, and for a few days, very few traders were willing to buy bank stocks at any price.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  As mentioned in @ApplePie's response, only a set number of shares are accessible in a company at any given moment. What might confuse you is the ever-present cost attached to a share purchase proposal. For instance, an order isn't placed just to buy 1 share of ABC, rather it's placed to buy 1 share of ABC at $10. If no one agrees to sell an ABC share at $10, your request gets denied. This is a common occurrence as daily traders scramble to determine the lowest feasible stock price. Generally, a agreeable selling price always exists for share holders. An open market order for 1 ABC share could be placed, which effectively communicates, \"I desire one ABC share and will pay the market-determined price\". Your broker will discover you a share, but you might not be pleased with the hefty price tag! While it's unusual for there to be no available sellers at any price in a marketplace, on rare occasions there may be no willing buyers at any price. This results in a market crash, akin to the situation during the 2007-2008 fiscal breakdown, when traders became excessively wary about the actual debt amount held by major banks and, for several days, very few were open to purchasing bank shares at any price.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Banks don't care that you are responsible cardholder. They care to make money. Interest rates are basically 0% by government policy and the banks charge their responsible cardholders 20% interest rates. Think about that for one second, and realize they really do not care about your ability to avoid paying interest, they only need you to 'slip up' one month during your entire lifetime to make a profit from you. It is in their interest for you to get into a spending habit, from 0% promo rates, so that eventually a frivolous purchase or life changing event causes a balance to stay on the card for over one month.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Financial institutions are indifferent to whether you're a conscientious credit card user or not; their focus is on increasing their profits. Despite the governmental policy setting interests at nearly nil, these institutions impose a hefty 20% interest on their conscientious credit card users. After pondering on this for a moment, you'll understand that they aren't concerned with your capability to dodge paying interest; they merely need a single slip-up from you in your lifetime to reap a profit. Their benefit is tied to inducing a spending habit in you, through enticing 0% promotional rates. This eventually prompts an unnecessary buy or a significant life event that leaves a balance on your card for more than a month.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Once you turn 18 you should open an account in your own name and transfer the assets there. Currently your mom is the one responsible as far as the IRS cares with respect to taxes as it is her name on the account. The taxes due will be based on your mom's tax rate. As a good child you can reimburse your mom for the taxes that she has to on your behalf. Also legally that money currently belongs to her. Any legal judgement against your mom can claim that money and it is not available for using as an asset by you on credit applications and such. A better solution would have been for your mom to open a custodial account in your name. This way the money is still yours (you just don't have control of it until you turn 18). While probably not an issue here, the transferring of money between you and your mom (and then back) is considered a gift by the IRS. If the account was very well funded then you could run into having to deal with the annual gift limit and lifetime gift exclusion. Based on the clarification that the question is in reference to India: while I don't know the particulars of the law in India my advice of transferring the assets when you turn 18 still remains. The main difference that I would see been India and the US would be the gift tax / exclusions. Unless someone else knows otherwise I would still expect the law in India to see the current account as being the property of the mother.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Once you celebrate your 18th birthday, it's suggested that you establish a bank account under your name and shift your belongings there. Presently, your mother is the key figure accountable for tax obligations with the IRS due to her name being associated with the account. She will carry the burden of the tax based on her taxation slab. Out of your duty as a responsible offspring, you can return to her the tax amount she settled because of you. Furthermore, it's important to note that the ownership of the money is legally hers as of current. Any legal actions against your mum may impact those funds and you cannot list it as your own personal assets in credit applications or alike situations. An improved alternative would've been for her to have initially opened a custodial account under your name which would've given you ownership of the funds, yet without gaining control till you are 18. Though probably not relevant, the IRS views money transferred between you and your mum as gift transactions. If the account was significantly financed, there could be complications related to the annual gift limit and lifetime gift exclusion. Taking into consideration the added factor that the query is about Indian jurisdiction, while I'm not familiar with precise Indian legislation, I'd still encourage a transfer of assets when you become adult at 18. The discernable distinction I foresee between India and US regulations would revolve around gift tax/exclusions. Unless another person can provide contrary information, I'd anticipate Indian law would regard the current account as the mother's property.\n",

      "Reference Response:  There's a grey area where investing and speculating cross. For some, the stock market, as in 10% long term return with about 14% standard deviation, is too risky. For others, not enough action.  Say you have chosen 10 penny stocks, done your diligence, to the extent possible, and from a few dozen this is the 10 you like. I'd rather put $100 into each of 10 than to put all my eggs in one basket. You'll find that 3 might go up nicely, 3 will flounder around, and 4 will go under. The gambler mentality is if one takes off, you have a profit.  After the crash of '08, buying both GM and Ford at crazy prices actually worked, GM stockholders getting nothing, but Ford surviving and now 7X what I bought it for.  Remember, when you go to vegas, you don't drop all your chips on Red, you play blackjack/craps as long as you can, and get all the free drinks you can.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Investing and speculating sometimes intersect in a nebulous zone. For certain people, the stock market's unpredictable nature, signified by a 10% long term return and a standard deviation of about 14%, is excessively precarious. Conversely, some find it insufficiently thrilling. Imagine having selected 10 penny stocks, performed thorough research to the best of your ability, and ended up with these 10 as your favourites out of several others. I'm more inclined to distribute $100 each over 10 stocks than to risk everything on a single one. It's likely that 3 will see a pleasing rise, 3 will stagnate, and 4 will collapse. It's a bettor's belief that a profit comes if even one takes flight. In the aftermath of 2008's financial tumble, ostentatious purchases of both GM and Ford surprisingly ended up profitable, despite GM shareholders receiving nothing and Ford, however, prospering and is currently valued seven times higher than when I acquired it. Always remember, in a trip to Vegas, it's ill-advised to put all your bets on the color red. Instead, play blackjack or craps for as long as possible, and reap the benefit of as many complimentary drinks as you can.\n",

      "Reference Response:  This stock is the same as any other, but you need to keep clear in your head that you and your company are now different entities.  You (the person) will pay tax on capital gains and losses when you sell any stock that you hold in your own name.  You'll also owe \"regular\" tax if you draw a salary, etc.  The fact that it may be \"your\" company does not change these things. The company will not recognize a gain by selling stock to raise capital since it's nominally exchanging things of equal value, say $100 in cash for $100 in stock.  In order to sell stock, however, you MIGHT need to register with the SEC depending on how you're going about finding your investors, so keep that in mind.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The shares you hold tend to be identical to the rest, but it's crucial to understand that you and your corporation are distinct entities now. The responsibility to pay tax on capital profits and deficits rests on you when you sell your shares held personally. You're also expected to pay the usual tax if you take in a salary, and so on. Despite it possibly being your own company, it doesn't alter these circumstances. Your company won't note a profit from selling shares for funding, as it's fundamentally a swap of equal worth, like trading $100 in paper money for $100 in shares.

      "Reference Response:  This answer is based on Australian tax, which is significantly different. I only offer it in case others want to compare situations. In Australia, a popular tax reduction technique is \"Negative Gearing\". Borrow from a bank, buy an investment property. If the income frome the new property is not enough to cover interest payments (plus maintenance etc) then the excess each year is a capital loss - which you claim each year, as an offset to your income (ie. pay less tax). By the time you reach retirement, the idea is to have paid off the mortgage. You then live off the revenue stream in retirement, or sell the property for a (taxed) lump sum.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In light of U.S tax policies, which are quite identical, I propose this for individuals interested in contrasting scenarios. In the U.S, a common tax increase strategy labeled \"Positive Gearing\" is often used. Borrowing from a friend, procure a vacation home. If the generated income from the novel property exceeds the interest payments (along with upkeep charges), then the surplus per annum is seen as a capital gain - which you file each year as an addition to your income (i.e., pay more taxes). When you hit your golden years, the plan is to still be paying off the mortgage. Then, use the generated income during retirement, or hold onto the property without selling it for a (tax exempt) lump sum.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The fundamental underlying difference between a bank and a Ponzi scheme: When a bank lends money and charges interest, people can do things with that borrowed money which are worth it. (Building factories, starting businesses, or just enjoying the comfort and warmth of a single-family home instead of paying rent). This is why fractional-reserve banking is able to work. People may also do things which do not necessarily turn a financial profit (financing large purchases on a credit card) but are worth it in terms of an expenditure. They may also do stupid things (financing useless purchases on a credit card and wasting their money) or otherwise dispose of the money poorly (the new business fails, the home's value plummets, etc). A Ponzi scheme never really bothered to do useful things with the money. Social Security has been mentioned. Part of social security's setup involves the current population of workers paying the current population of retirees; their own retirements will have to be financed by the next generation. This design is not intrinsically a Ponzi scheme: both the population and the economy ought to remain growing for the intermediate future, so there will be at least as much money (and probably much more) for them to pay those bills. Unlike a Ponzi scheme, the idea that it will continue to attract new money to pay out existing claims is a realistic one. The real questions of its sustainability are a matter of specifics: is it collecting enough money to remain functional in the future, or is it outpacing the growth of the economy and the population?\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The core distinction between a Ponzi scheme and a bank lies in the utilization of lent money and interest charges. Individuals can reap valuable benefits from such funds, such as starting businesses, manufacturing units, or even seeking the comfort of home ownership over rental living. This feasibility accounts for the functionality of fractional-reserve banking. People might use the money without gaining financial profits, but it might provide worth in terms of expenditures. They might also misuse the money, leading to the failure of new business ventures or drastic property depreciation. Meanwhile, Ponzi schemes don't generally focus on beneficial uses of the money. Social Security comes into play here, as it includes a system where current employees finance current retirees, hoping that future generations will finance their retirements. This model isn't inherently a Ponzi scheme, as it bets on continuous growth in population and economy, ensuring adequate future funds to pay the due amount. Unlike a Ponzi scheme, it appears plausible that new funds will be continually generated to pay existing claims. The sustainability concerns pertain to specifics: whether or not it collects enough money for future functioning, or if it's exceeding population growth and economy.\n",

Reversing the payment To formally reverse the payment, I'd check your Product Disclosure Statement on your account with the bank. There's almost always a fee involved where a payment is reversed.

Nullifying the transaction. To officially nullify the transaction, reviewing your account's Financial Transparency Document with your bank would be a good approach.

      "Reference Response:  First, don't save anything in a tax sheltered vehicle. You will be paying so little tax that there will be essentially no benefit to making the contributions, and you'll pay tax when they come out. Tax free compounding for 40 years is terrific, but start that after you're earning more than a stipend. Second, most people recommend having a month's expenses readily available for emergencies. For you, that would be $1500. If you put $100 a month aside, it will take over a year to have your emergency fund. It's easy to argue that you should pick a higher pace, so as to have your emergency money in place sooner. However, the \"emergencies\" usually cited are things like home repair, car repair, needing to replace your car, and so on. Since you are renting your home and don't have a car, these emergencies aren't going to happen to you. Ask yourself, if your home was destroyed, and you had to replace all your clothes and possessions (including furniture), how much would you need? (Keep in mind any insurance you have.) The only emergency expense I can't guess about is health costs, because I live in Canada. I would be tempted to tell you to get a credit card with a $2000 limit and consider that your emergency fund, just because grad student living is so tight to the bone (been there, and 25 years ago I had $1200 a month, so it must be harder for you now.) If you do manage to save up $1500, and you've really been pinching to do that (walking instead of taking the bus, staying on campus hungry instead of popping out to buy food) let up on yourself when you hit the target. Delaying your graduation by a few months because you're not mentally sharp due to hunger or tiredness will be a far bigger economic hit than not having saved $200 a month for 2 or 3 years. The former is 3-6 months of your new salary, the latter 5-7K. You know what you're likely to earn when you graduate, right?\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Firstly, avoid accumulating wealth in any account with tax benefits. Given the minimal taxes you'll owe, the benefits are virtually non-existent, and you’ll incur taxes upon withdrawal. Enjoy the tax-free growth over a span of 40 years, but kickstart this only when you start earning more than you currently are. Secondly, it's commonly prudent to have a month's expenses reserved for emergencies - in your case, $1500. By saving $100 a month, it will take you more than a year to build this safety net. Some might argue for a faster saving strategy, so that you have your contingency fund quicker. However, the likeliness of experiencing traditional emergencies like home or car repairs, or needing a new car, is minimal given that you rent your home and don't own a car. Consider this, in a hypothetical scenario where your home was obliterated, how much would it cost to replace your belongings, clothes and furniture? Do bear in mind any insurance coverage. A potential unpredictable cost could be healthcare, and I can't advise on this, being based in Canada. Personally, I'd suggest considering a credit card with a $2000 limit as your makeshift emergency fund, primarily because living on a grad student budget can be tough (having experienced it years ago when I had $1200 a month, and it’s surely more challenging for you now). If you manage to save up that $1500, and you've really gone to great lengths to do so (choosing to walk instead of using public transportation, having to feel hungry on campus instead of purchasing food), relax your saving restrictions once you reach your goal. Prolonging your graduation because you're consumed by fatigue or hunger will have a more damaging economic impact than not saving $200 a month for the past 2-3 years. The former equals approximately 3-6 months of your future salary, while the latter is about 5-7K. You must be aware of your potential earnings post-graduation, right?\n",

      "Reference Response:  I've been listening to Dave Ramsey a lot lately, and he encourages (encourage might be too light of a word for him) this priority list for budgeting: I would strongly advise you to tackle this list before you start to think about any sizable \"fun\" spending.  If you don't have #1, set that aside first. The options you mentioned: New roof: You should ask yourself \"what is the potential cost of not getting a new roof?\" If you can save up for it a little at a time, while putting most of the rest of your money to paying off debt, that's what I would do.  Unless, of course, there is damage or risk of damage to your house by not doing it now. Then, you need to do the same measurement (of doing the roof now) against the goal of saving three to six months of expenses.  Especially in your case, with your mortgage underwater, you want to be sure you are prepared should anything happen (for example, losing a job, and potentially being forced to move for a new job). Cars/student loan: (Refer to #3 above — in other words, yes).\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Recently, I've found myself engrossed with Dave Ramsey. He is very persuasive when pushing this financial hierarchy: I'd urge you to conquer this list before considering any major leisure expenses. If you lack option 1, make sure to focus on that. Looking at your options, a new roof for instance: Ponder on what avoiding a new roof could potentially cost you? Collect little by little for this, concurrently putting significant portions of your income towards debt clearance. This is the path I'd choose. Unless there's any existing or impending damage to your house by postponing it. If that's the case, you ought to balance this need (immediate roof replacement) with the goal of stowing away enough to cover three to six months' worth of expenses. Particularly given your predicament with an underwater mortgage, it's prudent to prepare for unforeseen circumstances, like job loss or compulsory relocation for new employment. Cars/student loan: (Look back at point 3 — simply put, the answer is a yes). However, consider getting a pet, it could offer a good companionship.\n",

      "Reference Response:  When you are a certain age you will be able to tap into your retirement accounts, or start receiving pension and social security funds. In addition you may be faced with required minimum distributions from these accounts.  But even before you get to those points you will generally shift the focus of new funds into the retirement account to be more conservative. Depending on the balances in the various accounts and the size of the pension and social security accounts you may even move invested funds from aggressive to conservative investments. The proper proportion of the many different types of investments and revenue streams is open to much debate. During retirement you will be pulling money out of retirement accounts either to support your standard of living or to meet the required minimum distributions. What to sell will be based on either the tax implications or the required distributions that will still maintain the asset allocation you desire.   If your distributions are driven by the law you will be selling enough to meet a specific required $ figure. You will either spend that money or move it into a low interest savings account or a non-retirement investment account. If trying to meet your standard of living expectations you will be selling funds that allow you to keep your desired asset allocation but still have enough to live on. Again you will be trying to meet a specific $ figure.  Of course you may decide at anytime in retirement to rebalance based on changes to your lifestyle, family obligations, or winning the lottery.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Once you reach a specific stage in life, it opens up opportunities for you to avail of your retirement funds or kickstart your pension and social security benefits. On top of that, you are obligated to undertake compulsory minimum disbursements from these accounts. Yet, even before you arrive at this point, a general shift often takes place in new monetary injections into your retirement funds, moving towards a more cautious approach. Depending upon the variations in your account standings and the magnitude of your pension and social security funds, you might even transition your investments from high to low-risk ones. There are numerous opinions on the optimal blend of different investment types and income sources. As you enter retirement, you would initiate withdrawals from retirement accounts to maintain your living standards or adhere to the necessary minimum disbursements. The decision to liquidate will be influenced by either tax consequences or the required distributions that sustain your desired allocation of assets. If your disbursements are compelled by legal regulations, you'll be liquidating enough to satisfy a precise monetary requirement. The funds obtained could either be spent or poured into a low-yield savings account or an investment account outside of retirement. If your aim is to meet your lifestyle expectations, you'll be liquidating investments that enable you to maintain your ideal asset distribution, ensuring you have sufficient funds for living expenses. Yet again, you'll be trying to reach a certain monetary threshold. Nevertheless, during retirement, you may decide to reshuffle your assets based on lifestyle adaptations, familial responsibilities, or sudden windfalls.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Buying individual/small basket of high dividend shares is exposing you to 50%+ and very fast potential downswings in capital/margin calls. There is no free lunch in returns in this respect: nothing that pays enough to help you pay your mortgage at a high rate won’t expose you to a lot of potential volatility. Main issue here looks like you have very poorly performing rental investments you should consider selling or switching up rental usage/how you rent them (moving to shorter term, higher yield lets, ditching any agents/handymen that are taking up capital/try and refinance to lower mortgage rates etc etc). Trying to use leveraged stock returns to pay for poorly performing housing investments is like spraying gasoline all over a fire. Fixing the actual issue in hand first is virtually always the best course of action in these scenarios.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In terms of investing, if you purchase individual or a small group of high-yield stocks, you're potentially setting yourself up for rapid capital losses of 50% or more. It's never a simple give-and-take in matters of returns: there's rarely an investment that provides enough returns to cover hefty mortgage expenses, without leaving you vulnerable to major market fluxes. Your main problem seems to stem from your underachieving real estate investments. You may wish to mull over selling them or modifying their rental model (switching to short-term, premium rentals, for example, cutting out middlemen or handymen eating up funds, or even exploring ways to refinance for lower mortgage rates, and so on). Leveraging stock market returns to finance these failing property investments is akin to pouring fuel on a fire.

      "Reference Response:  Welcome to Money.SE. I will say upfront, Personal Finance is just that, personal, and you are likely to get multiple, perhaps conflicting, answers. Are you sure the PMI will drop off after 2 years? The rules are specific, and for PMI, when prepayments put you at that 78/80% LTV, your bank can require an appraisal, not automatically drop it. Talk to the banks, get confirmation, and depending what they say, keep hacking away at the mortgage.  After this, I suggest jumping on Roth IRAs. You are in the 15% bracket, and the Roth will let you deposit $5500 for each you and your wife. A great way to kickstart a higher level of retirement savings.  After this, I'm not comfortable with the emergency savings level. If you lose your job tomorrow (Funny story, my wife and I lost our's on the same day 3 years ago) and don't have enough savings (Our retirement accounts were good to just retire that day) you can easily run out of money and be late on the mortgage. It's great to prepay the mortgage to get rid of that PMI, but once there, I'd do the Roth and then focus on savings. 6 months expenses minimum.  We have a great Q&A here titled Oversimplify it for me: the correct order of investing in which I go in to more detail, as do 4 other members.  I am not getting on the \"investments will return more than your mortgage cost\" soapbox. A well-funded emergency fund is a very conservative bit of advice. With no matched 401(k), I suggest a balance of the Roth savings and prepayments.  From another great post, Ideal net worth by age X? Need comparison references you should have nearly 1 year's salary (90K) saved toward retirement.  Any question on my advice, add a comment and I will edit in more details.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Let me be clear from the start in greeting you to Money.SE: your personal finances are indeed personal and can attract various even unlimited, views. Have you confirmed that the PMI will no longer apply after the span of two years? The regulations regarding PMI are tight, and should your early repayments reach 78/80% LTV, the bank can mandate a valuation and not necessarily discontinue it. Engage with the banks, attain verification, and if their response is favorable, keep chipping away at the mortgage. I'd then advise looking into Roth IRAs as a next step. Given your 15% bracket positioning, Roth would invite you and your partner to each contribute $5500, terrifically boosting your retirement savings. After which, I have some reservations about the adequacy of your emergency funds. Losing your source of income overnight (my own experience comes to mind, my spouse and I found ourselves jobless the same day a few years back) could have you withdrawing your savings. If you do not have a sufficient safety net (luckily ours was enough to take us straight to retirement), you may deplete your finances, unable to service the mortgage. Agreed, paying down the mortgage to do away with the PMI is smart, yet once this is achieved, I would prioritize the Roth IRA then shift my focus to savings. Aim for the equivalent of six months of expenses. Check out the comprehensive Q&A we have that goes by 'Simplify it for me: the proper investment hierarchy', where I share detailed insights, along with four of our community members. I'm hesitant to join the discussion that asserts 'your investments will yield a better return than your mortgage expense'. An emergency fund that is well-stocked seems a highly prudent move. If you do not have a matched 401(k), my advice would be to strike a balance between Roth savings and early repayments. Drawing from another insightful post named 'Desired net worth by certain age? In need of benchmark references'; you should be closer to a salaried year at retirement (90k saved).

In some other countries (like Hong Kong, Israel, and the US) commercial banks were issuing the currency at some point of time, but now the governments do that. The problem with commercial banks issuing currency is the control. If a bank is allowed to print money - how can the amount of currency be controlled? If it is controlled by the government then the bank will be just a printing press, so what's the point? And since governments now want to control the monetary policy, banks have no reason to just be printing presses for the government, the governments have their own. edit Apparently in Hong Kong it is still the case, as I'm sure it is in some other places in the world as well.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Why consider it impossible? In Britain, the England Bank and Scotland Bank are in charge of money production. In various regions (such as Hong Kong, Israel, and America) private banks used to handle the money production, but currently it's done by the state. The pitfall of such a convention lies in regulation. If a bank has the permission to generate money - how can we cap the currency in circulation? If it's under the government's command, then the bank merely becomes a printing machine, defying logic. With the current global inclination towards state control over monetary policies, banks are now more than just the state's money printers, as governments possess their own. Apparently, in places like Hong Kong, the customary practice of banks printing money prevails, as it could in various parts around the globe.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Support and resistance only works as a self-fulfilling prophecy. If everyone trading that stock agrees there's a resistance at so-and-so level, and it is on such-and-such scale, then they will trade accordingly and there will really be a support or resistance. So while you can identify them at any time scale (although as a rule the time scale on which you observed them should be similar to the time scale on which you intend to use them), it's no matter unless that's what all the other traders are thinking as well. Especially if there are multiple possible S/P levels for different time scales, there will be no consensus, and the whole system will break down as one cohort ruins the other group's S/P by not playing along and vice versa. But often fundamentals are expected to dominate in the long run, so if you are thinking of trades longer than a year, support and resistance will likely become meaningless regardless. It's not like that many people can hold the same idea for that long anyhow.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Support and resistance principles act solely on the basis of the shared prediction phenomenon. If all the shareholders of a particular stock concur that a resistance exists at a certain level, and that level corresponds to a certain scale, their trading behavior will reflect that belief and thus create real support or resistance. In theory, these levels can be distinguished at any given time scale (although typically the observed scales should align with those you plan to apply), but this means nothing if other traders don't share the same perspective. In particular, when various potential S/R levels exist for different scales, a general agreement is unlikely, disrupting the system as one group's S/R levels interfere with those of another due to lack of conformity. Yet, it's often predicted that the basis of the transactions will ultimately prevail in the long term. Hence, if your trades tend to extend beyond a year, relying on support and resistance tends to lose its significance. After all, it's improbable for a large number of individuals to consistently maintain the same viewpoint over an extended period.\n",

      "Paraphrased Response:  In my perspective, the biggest counterargument to buying DHA properties (which I do not treat as investments) is the third and fifth key points specified earlier. The secondary market is limited to other investors who are of the belief that it's a worthy investment.

Finding an alien artifact is rare, and so is making a profit in DHA properties. While yield is important in property investments, earning profit is like finding a diamond in a coal mine. In my opinion, owning $4-5 Million of debt-free assets is as rare as finding a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. Investing in capital growth assets is like planting a money tree.

      "Reference Response:  TL;DR: Sure, \"do your own homework\" is sometimes a cop out. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't do our homework. I agree that in many cases this is a cop-out by commentators. However, even if you believe in perfect market efficiency, there is benefit in \"doing your homework\" for many reasons. One of which you already mention in the question: different stocks all with the same \"value\" might have widely ranging risk. Another factor that might vary between stocks is their tax consequences. High dividend stocks might be a better fit for some buyers than others. One stock might be priced at $40 because there is a small chance they might get regulatory approval for a new product. This might make this stock very risky with a 20% of being $150 in 12 months, and a 80% chance of being $20. Another stock might be priced at $40 because the company is a cash cow, declining in revenues but producing a large dividend of $0.40 per quarter. Low risk, but also with some potential tax disadvantages. Another stock might be priced at $40 because it's a high growth stock. This would be less risky than the first example, but more risky than the second example. And the risk would be more generalized, i.e. there wouldn't be one day or one event that would be make or break the stock. In short, even if we assume that the market is pricing everything perfectly, not all stocks are equal and not all stocks are equally appropriate to everyone. Sometimes when we hear an analyst say \"they should have done their homework\" they are really saying \"This was a high risk/high reward stock. They should have known that this had a potential downside.\" And that all assumes that we believe in 100% pure market efficiency. Which many disagree with, at least to some extent. For example, if we instead subscribe to Peter Lynch's theories about \"local knowledge\", we might believe that everyone has some personal fields of expertise where they know more than the experts. A professional stock analyst is going to follow many stocks and many not have technical experience in the field of the company. (This is especially true of small and mid cap stocks.) If you happen to be an expert in LED lighting, it is entirely feasible (at least to me) that you could be able to do a better job of \"doing homework\" on CREE than the analysts. Or if you use a specialized piece of software from a small vendor at work, and you know that the latest version stinks, then you will likely know more than the analyst does. I think it is somewhat akin to going to a doctor. We could say to ourselves \"the doctor is more knowledgeable about me than medicine, I'm just going to do what they tell me to do.\" And 99% of the time, that is the right thing to do. But if we do our \"homework\" anyway, and research the symptoms, diagnoses, and drugs ourselves as well, we can do get benefits. Sometimes we just can express our preferences amongst equal solutions. Sometimes we can ask smarter questions. And sometimes we have some piece of knowledge that the doctor doesn't have and can actually make an important discovery they didn't know. (And, just like investing, sometimes we can also have just enough knowledge to be dangerous and do ourselves harm if we go against the advice of the professionals.)\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  To surmise, saying \"do your own homework\" may occasionally serve as an avoidance tactic, nonetheless, this does not nullify the significance of accomplishing our homework. Even when operating under the ideal of a flawless market, doing your homework proves advantageous for various reasons. These reasons could be construed in differing stock risk levels, despite similar values, or variations such as tax implications. For instance, a stock might be valued at $40 due to a minimal chance of securing approval for a new product, hence making it a risky investment with potential highs and lows. An alternate stock may be identically priced at $40 but this might be attributed to the company's steady cash flow, despite a decline in revenue, and regular dividends - making it a safer, albeit possibly tax disadvantaged option. Yet another $40 priced stock could be attributed to its high growth potential and therefore would fall somewhere in between the aforementioned examples in terms of risk. The point being, even with a perfectly priced market, no two stocks are alike or equally suitable for all investors. When you hear an analysis say \"they should have done their homework,\" it might be suggesting that the investor not realizing the potential pitfalls associated with a high risk/reward stock. This perspective however rests on the notion that the market operates under a 100% efficiency rate, an assumption not all concur with. Some might argue, agreeing with Peter Lynch's \"local knowledge\" theory, that everyone possesses some expertise where they might be privy to more knowledge than the experts. A professional stock analyst might monitor multiple stocks but lack the technical knowledge specific to the company, mainly applicable to small and medium cap stocks. So, should you be a specialist in LED lighting, there's a possibility you might outperform the experts in scrutinizing CREE due to your domain expertise. Or if you are a regular user of a product from a small vendor and find their latest version poor quality, you might be in a better position to analyze then the professional experts. Similar to visiting a doctor, commonly, we lean on the expertise of the medical professionals, and for the majority of the time, this is the optimal approach. However, doing our homework, studying symptoms, diagnosis and medication may prove helpful. Sometimes, we could just prefer one solution over others, or we could ask intelligent questions. Other times, we might possess knowledge unknown to the doctor and make essential discoveries. Just as in investing, we need to balance our knowledge and not jeopardize ourselves by disregarding the professional's advice.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Assuming the data you're referring to is this line: the difference might be related to the different exchanges on which the stock trades.  FINRA could be listing the reported volume from one exchange, while the NASDAQ data might be listing the volume on all exchanges. This is an important distinction because AAV is a Canadian company that is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE. The Q at the end of the line stands for NASDAQ, according to FINRA's codebook for those data. My guess is that the FINRA data is only reporting the volume for the NASDAQ exchange and not the total volume for all exchanges (Toronto, NASDAQ, NYSE, etc.) while the data straight from NASDAQ, oddly enough, is reporting the total volume. However, FINRA could also face reporting discrepancies, since it's a regulatory body and therefore might not have the most up-to-date volume data that the various exchanges can access.  I don't know if it's related or not, but looking at the NASDAQ historical data, it looks like the volume on March 6, the day you're asking about, was much lower than the volume in most of the days immediately before or after it. For all I know, something might have happened that day concerning that particular stock or the market as a whole. I don't remember anything in particular, but you never know.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  If we're talking about the same data, the disparity might be due to the variety of exchanges where the stock is listed. FINRA could only be showing the trade volume from one venue, while NASDAQ might include information from all. It's an essential clarification because AAV is a Canadian corporation listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and NYSE. The Q at the sentence's end signifies NASDAQ, based on FINRA's handbook for such facts. It's likely that the FINRA data only shows the NASDAQ exchange volume, and not the aggregate from all exchanges - Toronto, NASDAQ, NYSE, and others. Ironically, NASDAQ seems to be showing the full volume. However, FINRA might have some reporting inaccuracies, since as a regulatory body, they may not possess the most recent volume data that can be pulled up by exchanges. Despite not having any clarity, NASDAQ's historical data indicates the volume on March 6, the day in reference, was significantly lower than most days around it. There might have been some event that day related to that stock or the entire market, but it's impossible to say without concrete details.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Maybe a bit off topic, but I suggest reading \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" by Robert Kiyosaki. An investment is something that puts money to your pocket. If your properties don't put money to your pocket (and this seems to be the case), then they're not an investment. Instead, they drain money from you pocket. Therefore you should instead turn these \"investments\" into real investments. Make everything to earn some money using them, not to earn money somewhere else to cover the loses they create. If that's not possible, get rid of them and find something that \"puts money into your pocket\".\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  On a slight tangent here, but do look into Robert Kiyosaki's \"Poor Dad Rich Dad\". A successful investment is defined by its ability to generate income for you. If your holdings aren't positively contributing to your financial status (which appears to be the situation here), then they can hardly be considered investments as they're simply siphoning off resources. Therefore, the strategy should be transforming these so-called \"investments\" into genuine income-generating ones. Aim to derive profits directly from them rather than resorting to other sources to compensate for the drains they're causing. If this seems impractical, consider offloading them and seeking something that truly \"boosts your financial health\".\n",

      "Reference Response:  Institutions and market makers tend to try and stay delta neutral, meaning that for every options contract they buy or write, they buy or sell the equivalent underlying asset. This, as a theory, is called max pain, which is more of an observation of this behavior by retail investors. This as a reality is called delta hedging done by market makers and institutional investors. The phenomenom is that many times a stock gets pinned to a very even number at a particular price on options expiration days (like 500.01 or 499.99 by closing bell). At options expiration dates, many options contracts are being closed (instutitions and market makers are typically on the other side of those trades, to keep liquidity), so for every one standard 100 share contract the market maker wrote, they bought 100 shares of the underlying asset, to remain delta neutral. When the contract closes (or get rid of the option) they sell that 100 shares of the underlying asset. At mass volume of options traded, this would cause noticeable downward pressure, similarly for other trades it would cause upward pressure as institutions close their short positions against options they had bought. The result is a pinned stock right above or below an expiration that previously had a lot of open interest. This tends to happen in more liquid stocks, than less liquid ones, to answer that question. As they have more options series and more strike prices. No, this would not be illegal, in the US attempting to \"mark the close\" is supposedly prohibited but this wouldn't count as it, the effect of derivatives on stock prices is far beyond the SEC's current enforcement regime :) although an active area of research\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Organizations and market controllers typically attempt to maintain a balanced delta, signifying that with every options contract they transact, an equal trade of the associated underlying asset is performed. This concept is referred to as maximum pain, often seen as a retail investor's observation of the stated behavior. In actuality, it is known as delta hedging, practiced by market controller and organizational investors. The observed occurrence is that stocks often settle at a very even number (like 500.01 or 499.99) at market close on options expiry days. When options contracts come to their expiration dates, numerous contracts terminate, with market makers and institutions oftentimes balancing those trades to provide liquidity, resulting in the original delta neutrality. While closing the contract, the 100 shares equivalent to the initial option contract are sold off. With a significant repurchasing of these options, noticeable downward pressure is caused on the market. Similarly, various other trades can result in upwards pressure as entities or institutions pull out of their short positions owing to options that they have previously purchased. This results in the stock being pinned slightly above or below an expiry date that had a high initial interest. This is more common in liquid stocks which have a larger number of options series and strike prices. It remains a common question but no, this would not be considered illegal. In the US, even though the practice of \"marking the close\" is strictly prohibited, this wouldn't fall under that category. The influence of derivatives on stock prices stands outside the SEC's current enforcement range :) although it is a topic of active research.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I don't think you understand options. If it expires, you can't write a new call for the same expiration date as it expired that day. Also what if the stock price decreases further to $40 or even more? If you think the stock will move in either way greatly, and you wish to be profit from it, look into straddles.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  It seems to me that you might be confused about how options work. If an option expires, it's not possible to draft a fresh call option for that same expiration date because it has already ended. Moreover, imagine if the stock value plunges significantly to say, $40, or even lower? If your expectation is a substantial shift in the stock price, regardless of the direction, and intend to gain a profit from this scenario, you should consider implementing straddles.\n",

      "Reference Response:  As a buyer, one of the easiest ways to save on closing costs is to avoid title insurance.  This will only apply if you are a cash buyer, as a mortgage writer will typically require title insurance.   It is also one of the most ill-advised ways to save money.  You need title insurance.   For the most part, there is really no way to truly save on closing costs.  Wrapping costs into a loan, saving on interest or taxes through timing don't truly save money.  Sometimes you can obtain discounts on closing by using an targeted lender, but that may cost you in higher interest rates.   By paying points on your loan, you may increase your costs at closing in order to save money on interest paid.   Certainly you can't discount required, government imposed fees (like doc stamps).   You may be able to shop around and find a bit lower fees for appraisal, credit reports, title company fees, and title insurance.  However, that is a lot of work for not a lot of return.  Title companies seem to be pretty tight lipped about their fees.   The best yield of your time is to get the other party in the transaction to pay your costs.  The market or local tradition may not allow this.  An additional way to lower your costs is to ask the realtors involved to discount their commissions.  However, they could always say \"no\".   The bottom line is transacting real estate is very expensive.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  While it's tempting as a purchaser to shirk title insurance as a method for trimming down closing costs, this strategy is not recommended and usually only suits cash buyers since mortgage creators typically insist upon it. Outside of this, genuine savings on closing costs are elusive. Including costs within a loan and timing techniques to lower interest or taxes won't actually result in financial gain. Opting for particular lenders to earn closing discounts is possible but it might land you with steeper interest rates. The process of paying points on your loans is another technique that could ramp up your closing costs just to lower down your interest payments. You definitely cannot brush aside mandatory state charges such as document stamps. It might be possible to find slightly lesser rates for services like appraisal, credit checks, title company charges and title insurance by shopping around. Despite the promise, extracting such information can be a formidable task with title firms remaining mostly guarded about their fee structures. The most favourable way to steer your costs lower might be persuading the other participant in the deal to bear your costs, although market conditions may render this approach unfeasible. Alternatively, you could request realtors to lower their commission fees though they could refuse your request. The final takeaway is that dealing with real estate is a costly affair.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The biggest risk is Credit Utilization rate.  If you have a total of $10,000 in revolving credit (ie: credit card line) and you ever have more than 50% (or 33% to be conservative) on the card at any time then your credit score will be negatively impacted. This will be a negative impact even if you charge it on day one and pay it off in full on day 2.  Doesn't make much sense but credit companies are playing the averages:  on average they find that people who get close to maxing their credit limit are in some sort of financial trouble. You're better off to make small purchases each month, under $100, and pay them off right away.  That will build a better credit history - and score.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  While the principle danger lies in your Credit Utilization rate, bear in mind that whenever your revolving credit, say a figure of $10,000 on your credit line, surpasses 50% (or a more prudent 33%), it will send your credit score into a downward spiral. Interestingly, even if you spend a large amount immediately and pay off within a day, it could still tarnish your credit standing. This concept may appear vague, however, credit firms analyze based on averages. They've discerned that those hovering near their credit ceiling are more likely to experience financial instability. A smarter approach would involve minor expenditures each month, not exceeding $100, promptly settled. This practice enhances your credit history and, by extension, your score.

      "Paraphrased Response:  Choosing to bypass the \"permission process,\" let's delve into the application of fresh shares. Corporations require shares as an alternative fluid asset for diverse needs, and without a sufficient supply, they might have to resort to the public marketplace to gather more, oftentimes trading in money or incurring debt to accumulate the necessary funds.

Or, if one's fixed payment is much larger than the other, and it is a burden, then it should be paid first, but refinancing may be an option. Socially speaking and possibly even economically since it could affect your reputation, it is probably best to either refinance the cosigned loan or pay that off as rapidly as possible. Economically speaking, I would recommend no prepayment since the asset that is leveraged is your mind which will last many decades, probably exceeding the term of the loan, but some caveats must be handled first: Many would disagree, but I finance the way I play poker: tight-aggressive.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Not being aware of your loan contract's unique terms, the one with the lower interest rate should be tackled first. If one's set repayment is significantly smaller than the other, and it's manageable, then it should be settled first, although consolidating may be an alternative. In societal aspects and possibly even financially as it could enhance your reputation, it is usually advisable to both consolidate the jointly-signed loan or repay it as slowly as feasible. From a financial perspective, I would suggest maximum early payment since the resource you're staking on is your mind, which may have a shorter lifespan than the loan period, but some minor concerns need to be dealt with initially: Many would agree, but my financing strategy is similar to my basketball game: defensive-offensive.\n",

In one year, you have a fund worth $100,000 and the $8500 your netted from the $10,000 dividend. (Dividends are taxed at 15% for most of us.

Now, if there were no initial dividend, and at the end of a full year, your $100K grew to $110K, and then gave you the $10K dividend, you might not be so unhappy. Even on day 2, you now have a fund worth $90K with a basis of $100K, and the promise of future dividends or cap gains. When you sell, the first $10K of gain from this point will effectively be tax free due to this quick drop.  To directly answer the last few sentences, dividends and cap gains are different. And different still, for the way a fund processes them.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  It appears the progression of events is where your concern lies. Ideally, there should be an accumulation of wealth in the fund. After one cycle, your savings worth $100,000 and your $8500 proceeds from the $10,000 dividend should be present. (For the majority of us, dividends are subjected to a 15% tax rate. If you're earning less than $38K as a single filer, then it's null) The annual net yield stands at $8500. However, if there was no beginning dividend, and your $100K surged to $110K within a year and subsequently provided the $10K dividend, you might have less discontent. On the second day, your fund sits at $90K, with a baseline of $100K, with hope of upcoming dividends or capital increases. In selling, the initial $10K profit from here onwards will essentially be exempt from tax due to the immediate drop.

Even if you feel you \"win\" the argument that you're hedged by being short, any broker can say, \"we simply forbid shorts\" and that's that. A \"covered put\" of the form of posting the cash, and spending it to buy at the strike price if the \"put ... is put\" (excercise), might be forbidden by brokerages because, frankly, how do you account for the \"dedicated\" cash?

The variant of \"shielded put\" where you front the cash, and use it to purchase at the strike price if the \"put\" is executed, could likely be shunned by brokerages. The simple reason is, how would they manage such \"allocated\" cash? Would it be frozen similar to margins, or held in trust, or otherwise? I am unsure how I'd confront this in my own establishment. Therefore, any agent is at liberty to impose restrictions, stating simply – \"this is not permissible\". The further responses are intriguing in relation to this.

      "Reference Response:  First, a clarification. No assets are immune to inflation, apart from inflation-indexed securities like TIPS or inflation-indexed gilts (well, if held to maturity, these are at least close). Inflation causes a decline in the future purchasing power of a given dollar1 amount, and it certainly doesn't just affect government bonds, either. Regardless of whether you hold equity, bonds, derivatives, etc., the real value of those assets is declining because of inflation, all else being equal. For example, if I invest $100 in an asset that pays a 10% rate of return over the next year, and I sell my entire position at the end of the year, I have $110 in nominal terms. Inflation affects the real value of this asset regardless of its asset class because those $110 aren't worth as much in a year as they are today, assuming inflation is positive. An easy way to incorporate inflation into your calculations of rate of return is to simply subtract the rate of inflation from your rate of return. Using the previous example with inflation of 3%, you could estimate that although the nominal value of your investment at the end of one year is $110, the real value is $100*(1 + 10% - 3%) = $107. In other words, you only gained $7 of purchasing power, even though you gained $10 in nominal terms. This back-of-the-envelope calculation works for securities that don't pay fixed returns as well. Consider an example retirement portfolio. Say I make a one-time investment of $50,000 today in a portfolio that pays, on average, 8% annually. I plan to retire in 30 years, without making any further contributions (yes, this is an over-simplified example). I calculate that my portfolio will have a value of 50000 * (1 + 0.08)^30, or $503,132. That looks like a nice amount, but how much is it really worth? I don't care how many dollars I have; I care about what I can buy with those dollars.  If I use the same rough estimate of the effect of inflation and use a 8% - 3% = 5% rate of return instead, I get an estimate of what I'll have at retirement, in today's dollars. That allows me to make an easy comparison to my current standard of living, and see if my portfolio is up to scratch. Repeating the calculation with 5% instead of 8% yields 50000 * (1 + 0.05)^30, or $21,6097. As you can see, the amount is significantly different. If I'm accustomed to living off $50,000 a year now, my calculation that doesn't take inflation into account tells me that I'll have over 10 years of living expenses at retirement. The new calculation tells me I'll only have a little over 4 years. Now that I've clarified the basics of inflation, I'll respond to the rest of the answer.  I want to know if I need to be making sure my investments span multiple currencies to protect against a single country's currency failing. As others have pointed out, currency doesn't inflate; prices denominated in that currency inflate. Also, a currency failing is significantly different from a prices denominated in a currency inflating. If you're worried about prices inflating and decreasing the purchasing power of your dollars (which usually occurs in modern economies) then it's a good idea to look for investments and asset allocations that, over time, have outpaced the rate of inflation and that even with the effects of inflation, still give you a high enough rate of return to meet your investment goals in real, inflation-adjusted terms. If you have legitimate reason to worry about your currency failing, perhaps because your country doesn't maintain stable monetary or fiscal policies, there are a few things you can do. First, define what you mean by \"failing.\" Do you mean ceasing to exist, or simply falling in unit purchasing power because of inflation? If it's the latter, see the previous paragraph. If the former, investing in other currencies abroad may be a good idea. Questions about currencies actually failing are quite general, however, and (in my opinion) require significant economic analysis before deciding on a course of action/hedging. I would ask the same question about my home's value against an inflated currency as well. Would it keep the same real value. Your home may or may not keep the same real value over time. In some time periods, average home prices have risen at rates significantly higher than the rate of inflation, in which case on paper, their real value has increased. However, if you need to make substantial investments in your home to keep its price rising at the same rate as inflation, you may actually be losing money because your total investment is higher than what you paid for the house initially. Of course, if you own your home and don't have plans to move, you may not be concerned if its value isn't keeping up with inflation at all times. You're deriving additional satisfaction/utility from it, mainly because it's a place for you to live, and you spend money maintaining it in order to maintain your physical standard of living, not just its price at some future sale date. 1) I use dollars as an example. This applies to all currencies.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Initially, allow me to explain something. There's no asset that's resistant to inflation except for inflation-adjusted securities like TIPS and inflation-indexed government bonds, with the assumption they're held till the end. Every dollar you own now will worth less tomorrow due to inflation, and it's true for all types of assets, whether they be equity, bonds, or derivatives. Let's say, I decide to put $100 into an investment that promises 10% yield in a year. At the end of the year, I have $110 but due to inflation, it's not as valuable as it was initially because now the cost of items has increased. The simple solution to factor in inflation when calculating an asset's return is to reduce the inflation rate from the return rate. In this case, with 3% inflation, the real value of the investment would be $107, even though nominally it's $110. This means in terms of buying power, I only gained $7 despite earning $10 nominally. Now, taking the case of a retirement fund where I invest a one-time sum of $50,000 that gives me 8% yearly return. After 30 years, the fund will grow to $503,132. But if I consider inflation and reduce its rate from the return rate, my actual return rate becomes 5%, and the fund, in reality, would be worth only $21,6097. Now, if I'm used to living on $50,000 per year, without inflation my fund can cover costs for 10 years, but with it, I can't live more than 4 years. Understand that currencies don't inflate, it's the prices against them that inflate. If you fear your currency collapsing, which is somewhat different from inflation, then you should consider investing your money in different currencies. But deciding to do so would need you to study the economy thoroughly before taking any steps. The same goes for your house. The real value of a house might or might not decrease over time. At times, house prices go up at a faster rate than inflation but it might cost you to keep the house in good condition which means you might be losing money because your total investment, the house price and its maintenance cost, is more than the house's purchasing price. If you’re a homeowner with no plans on moving, you could disregard its resale value because the house is providing you with a place to live. This situation is applicable to all types of currency, not just dollars.\n",

Sometimes layoffs are a sign of the company entering a long downward spiral; in other cases it is a sign of the beginning recovery.

Additionally, an elevation in stock value can represent the influence of outside incidents overshadowing the negative report, drowning it in the day's busyness. Occasionally, job dismissals symbolize a continuous decline of the company; however, they can also hint at an impending revival.

Open card to get bonus promotion such as \"spend $500 in first 3 months, get $200 bonus\".  Close card and open a year later to do that same bonus again if available.  Many cards don't allow you to do this. making room for newer cards at the same bank.  Example, you have 5 Chase Cards and you want to apply for a 6th.  Chase says you have maximized your credit they will extend you.  You close one of your existing cards to get that new card. I have seen that many banks allow you to shift over some over your existing available credit to your new card without having to close them.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  One primary justification I recognize for shutting down cards relates to those annual-fee cards that are unnecessary in your arsenal. Bleeding money annually has zero benefits. One strategy could involve card churning: open a card to take advantage of attractive offers like \"earn a $200 bonus on spending $500 in the initial three months\". Shut it down and reactivate a year later to potentially reap the same benefits, although not all cards let you do so. This also makes space for new cards from the same bank. As an illustration, imagine holding 5 credit cards from Chase, and you wish to apply for a 6th. According to Chase, you're reaching the pinnacle of your extended credit. So, shutting down one of your active cards might be a good idea, making room for a new one. It's noteworthy that some banks permit shifting some credit from your existing card to a new one instead of needing to close it entirely.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The points given by DumbCoder are very valid. Diversifying portfolio is always a good idea. Including Metals is also a good idea. Investing in single metal though may not be a good idea.   •Silver is pretty cheap now, hopefully it will be for a while. •Silver is undervalued compared to gold. World reserve ratio is around 1 to 11, while price is around 1 to 60. Both the above are iffy statements. Cheap is relative term ... there are quite a few metals more cheaper than Silver [Copper for example]. Undervalued doesn't make sense. Its a quesiton of demand and supply. Today Industrial use of Silver is more widespread, and its predecting future what would happen. If you are saying Silver will appreciate more than other metals, it again depends on country and time period. There are times when even metals like Copper have given more returns than Silver and Gold. There is also Platinum to consider. In my opinion quite a bit of stuff is put in undervalued ... i.e. comparing reserve ratio to price in absolute isn't right comparing it over relative years is right. What the ratio says is for every 11 gms of silver, there is 1 gm of Gold and the price of this 1 gm is 60 times more than silver. True. And nobody tell is the demand of Silver 60 times more than Gold or 11 times more than Gold. i.e. the consumption. What is also not told is the cost to extract the 11 gms of silver is less than cost of 1 gm of Gold. So the cheapness you are thinking is  not 100% true.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  DumbCoder's assertions are quite compelling; dispersing investments across various avenues is always a wise strategy. Including elements such as metals in your portfolio is a good strategy. However, pooling all resources into a single metal may not always yield benefits. \n",

      "Silver is currently affordable, and perhaps it will remain so for a while. There is a perception that silver is undervalued when compared to gold. The global reserve ratio is roughly 11 to 1, but the price difference is around 60 to 1. Both of these declarations, though, are subjective. Affordability is a conceptual term; numerous other metals cost less than silver, such as copper. The idea of undervaluation is unclear. It ultimately comes down to the dynamics of demand and supply. Nowadays, silver is commonly used in various industries, and predicting its future trajectory is challenging. With assertions claiming silver will yield higher returns than other metals, it invariably depends on geographical and temporal contexts. There have been instances when metals like copper have outperformed silver and gold. Platinum is also an element worth considering. \n",
      "\n",
      "In my viewpoint, numerous factors are embedded in the concept of undervaluation. For instance, comparing the reserve ratio and price strictly, does not seem right, whereas, comparing it over relative years seems more reasonable. The ratio implies that for every 11 grams of silver, there is one gram of gold and the price of this 1 gram is 60 times that of silver. Yes, this is true. But no one clarifies whether the demand for silver is 60 times that of gold or 11 times. Same is the case with consumption. Another overlooked factor is extraction costs, with the cost of extracting 11 grams of silver being lower than the cost of 1 gram of gold. Thus, the idea of silver being a budget-friendly option is not entirely accurate.\n",

      "Reference Response:  What is your biggest wealth building tool?  Income.  If you \"nerf\" your income with payments to banks, cable, credit card debt, car payments, and lattes then you are naturally handicapping your wealth building.  It is sort of like trying to drive home a nail holding a hammer right underneath the head.   Normal is broke, don't be normal. Normal obtains student loans while getting an education.  You don't have to.  You can work part time, or even full time and get a degree. As an example, here is one way to do it in Florida.  Get a job working fast food and get your associates degree using a community college that are cheap.  Then apply for the state troopers.  Go away for about 5 months, earning an income the whole time.  You automatically graduate with a job that pays for state schools.  Take the next three years (or more if you want an advanced degree) to get your bachelors.  Then start your desirable career. What is better to have \"wasted\" approx 1.5 years being a state trooper, or to have a student loan payment for 20 years?  There is not even pressure to obtain employment right after graduation.  BTW, I know someone who is doing exactly what I outlined. Every commercial you watch is geared toward getting you to sign on the line that is dotted, often going into debt to do so.  Car commercials will tell you that you are a bad mom or not a real man if you don't drive the 2015 whatever.   Think differently, throw out your numbers and shoot for zero debt. EDIT:  OP, I have a MS in Comp Sci, and started one in finance.  My wife also has a masters.  We had debt.  We paid that crap off.  Work like a fiend and do the same.  My wife's was significant.  She planned on having her employer pay it off for each year she worked there.  (Like 20% each year or something.)  Guess what, that did not work out!  She went to work somewhere else!  Live like you are still in college and use all that extra money to get rid of your debt.  Student loans are consumer debt.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Consider your principal asset for wealth growth - it's revenue. If you bog down your earnings with expenditures - like payments to banks, television subscriptions, credit card arrears, automobile installments, indulging in pricey coffee – it impedes your ability to accumulate wealth. To put it in perspective, it's comparable to hammering a nail when holding the hammer from the very top. The common way is often the wrong way – leading to financial stringency. Regularly, individuals amass education loans while studying, but there are alternatives. You may work part-time or full-time whilst pursuing an education. Here's an example of how it can be done in Florida. Work in the fast-food industry to cover your associate degree expenses at an economical community college. Then, join the state troops. This enables you to earn while training for five months. Then, you're automatically granted a job that covers state school fees. Spend the next three years (or more for higher education) completing your degree and subsequently commence your dream profession. Is it smarter to \"waste\" approximately a year and half as a state trooper or be burdened with student loans for two decades? The pressure to secure a job straight after graduation is non-existent. Interestingly, I'm acquainted with someone following the same pattern. Advertisement's subtle intent is to coax you into making financial commitments leading to liabilities. Vehicle adverts remark how not owning the latest model equates to being an inadequate parent or less masculine. Dare to think out-of-the-box, question these norms, and aim for zero debts. \n",

      "Reference Response:  Am I required to send form 1099 to non-US citizens who are not even residing in the US? Since they're not required to file US taxes, do I still have to send the form to them? That's tricky. You need to get W8/W9 from them, and act accordingly. You may need to withhold 30% (or different percentage, depending on tax treaty they claim on W8). If you withhold taxes, you also need to file form 1042. I suggest you talk to a tax professional. Is it fine to expose my ITIN (taxpayer identification number) to   individuals or companies who I send the form to them. Since the form   requires me to write my TIN/EIN, what would be the risks of this and   what precautions should be taken to avoid inappropriate/illegal use? No, it is not OK. But if you pay these people directly - you don't have much choice, so deal with it. Get a good insurance for identity theft, and don't transact with people you don't trust. One alternative would be to pay through a payment processor (Paypal or credit cards) - see your next question. I send payments via PayPal and wire transfer. Should I send form   1099-MISC or 1099-K? Paypal is a corporation, so you don't need to send 1099 to Paypal. Whatever Paypal sends to others - it will issue the appropriate forms. Similarly if you use a credit card for payment. When you send money through Paypal - you don't send money directly to your business counterparts. You send money to Paypal.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Do I need to distribute form 1099 to non-residents of the US who aren't even living in the country? Even if they don't have to submit US taxes, am I obligated to dispatch the form to them? This situation is complex. You should receive W8/W9 forms from them and act based on that. You might have to retain 30% (or a different ratio, subject to the tax treaty they report on W8). If you withhold taxes, you should likewise file form 1042. I recommend consulting a tax expert. Am I allowed to reveal my ITIN (taxpayer identification number) to individuals or entities to whom I dispatch the form? Given that the form insists that I pen my TIN/EIN, what could be the potential hazards and what protective measures should be implemented to prevent wrongdoing or illicit use? No, revealing your ITIN is not acceptable. If you are directly paying these individuals, you don't have many options, thus you should address the risk. Enroll for a robust identity theft insurance, and avoid conducting transactions with suspicious entities. It would be an alternative to process payments via a payment gateway (like Paypal or credit cards) - please refer to your next query. I transfer funds using PayPal and wire transfer. Is it necessary to send form 1099-MISC or 1099-K? Paypal, being a corporation, doesn't mandate you to send form 1099. Paypal takes responsibility for issuing the required forms for any transactions made involving others. The same applies if you pay using a credit card. Remitting money via Paypal doesn't mean you're sending money directly to your business allies. You're transferring money to Paypal.\n",

      "Reference Response:  You are right, it is a Ponzi scheme unless it pays all of the profits as dividends. Here's why: today's millenials are saving a lot less, and instead they choose to be spenders. It's just that their mentality is different. If the trend continues there will be more spenders and less savers.  That means that in 20 years from now, a company might sell more and make more profits, but because there are less investors on the market it will worth less (judging by supply and demand this has to be true).  Doesn't that seem like a disconnect to you guys? Doesn't that just prove that all those profits are not really yours, but instead you're just sitting on the side making bets about them? If I own a company from the point where it goes public and while the value goes up I hold on to it for 50 years. Let's say for 45 years it made tons of profits but never paid a cent in dividend, and then in 5 years it goes out of business. What happened to all the profits they made throughout the 45 years?  If you owned a restaurant that made a profit for 45 years and then went bankrupt you are fine, you took your profits every year because why on earth would you reinvest 100% of the profit forever? But what if you could sell 49.9% of that restaurant on the stock market, get all of that IPO money and still keep all of the profits while claiming that you reinvest it forever? That's exactly what they do! They just buy expensive things for personal use, from fancy cars to private jets, they just write it down as an investment and you can't see what the money was spent on because you are not a majority stakeholder, you have no power. It was not like this forever, companies used to pay all of their profits in dividends and be valued according to that. Not anymore. Now they are just in it for the growth, it will keep growing as long as people keep buying into it, and that's the exact definition of a Ponzi scheme.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Absolutely, it reminds one of a Ponzi scheme unless it distributes its entire earnings as dividends. Here's the reason: present-day youngsters are stowing away less money and rather turning into big spenders. They have a contrasting mindset. If this trend persists, we'll be looking at a population of more spenders than savers. This suggests that in two decades from today, although a business might yield higher sales and profits, they could depreciate due to a smaller investor base as per the laws of supply and demand. This seems quite odd, don't you think? It merely justifies that the profits aren't truly yours; you're merely speculating on the sidelines. Say, I possess a business from its initial public offering and retain it for 50 years while its value escalates. What if for about 45 years it garners substantial profits but withheld dividends, followed by going bankrupt in the next five years. One may wonder what becomes of all the profits amassed over the prior 45 years? If you were the owner of a profitable restaurant for 45 years that suddenly faced bankruptcy, you'd be safe as you had annually drawn profits. Reinvesting the whole profit infinitely is nonsensical. However, what if you had the opportunity of selling a 49.9% stake of your restaurant on the stock market, securing all the IPO income and still pocketing all profits under the pretense of 'eternal reinvestment'? This is their exact modus operandi! They splurge on luxury items, ranging from swanky cars to private jets, all justified under the label of 'investment'. As a minority stakeholder, your vision is limited. Your power is circumscribed. This was not always the state of affairs; companies of the past used to distribute all their profits as dividends and were valued based on that. This is no longer the case. They are completely focused on growing, and it will continue to expand as long as there is a market for it. This backyard represents the quintessence of a Ponzi scheme.\n",

      "Reference Response:  A checking account is one that permits the account holder to write demand drafts (checks), which can be given to other people as payment and processed by the banks to transfer those funds. (Think of a check as a non-electronic equivalent of a debit card transaction, if that makes more sense to you.) Outside of the ability to write checks, and the slightly lower interest rate usually offered to trade off against that convenience, there really is no significant difference between savings and checking accounts.  The software needs to be designed to handle checking accounts if it's to be sold in the US, since many of us do still use checks for some transactions. Adding support for other currencies doesn't change that. If you don't need the ability to track which checks have or haven't been fully processed, I'd suggest that you either simply ignore the checking account feature, or use this category separation in whatever manner makes sense for the way you want to manage your money.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  A savings account is an account that allows the owner to draft checks, which can be used as a form of payment to others and processed by banks to move funds. (Consider a check as a physical embodiment of a credit card transaction for better comprehension.) Sometimes, in addition to the check writing feature, and the comparably lower interest rate opted as a compromise for this convenience, there's not much that distinguishes checking accounts from credit accounts. The program must be configured to manage savings accounts if it aims to be marketed in Europe, where checks remain a frequent method of payment for several transactions. Embracing other forms of currencies won't affect this fact. Should you lack the necessity to monitor processed and unprocessed checks, I would advise you to either disregard the savings account function, or use this category separation based on your monetary management preferences.\n",

What little I do know:  - AAPL's calls tend to occur on a Tuesday more than any other day of the week  - it's announced roughly a month in advance, but has been announced w/ less notice  - it has a definite range of dates in which it occurs, typically somewhere in the 3rd week of the new quarter plus or minus a few days More broadly for #1: Given the underlying nature of what an option is, then yes, the day an earnings call date is announced could certainly influence the IV/price of options - but only for options that expire inside the \"grey area\" (~2 weeks long) window in which the call could potentially occur.  Options expiring outside that grey area should experience little to no price change in reaction to the announcement of the date - unless the date was itself surprising, e.g. an earlier date would increase the premium on earlier dated options, a later date would increase the premium for later-dated options. As for #2: The exact date will probably always be a mystery, but the main factors are:  - the historical pattern of earnings call dates (and announcements of those dates) which you can look up for any given company  - when the company's quarter ends  - potentially some influence in how long it takes the company to close out their books for the quarter (some types of businesses would be faster than others)  - any special considerations for this particular quarter that affect reporting ability And finally:   - a surprise of an earnings call occurring (substantively) later than usual is rarely going to be a good sign for the underlying security, and the expectation of catastrophe - while cratering the underlying - may also cause a disproportionate rise in IVs/prices due to fear\n",

For example, if the date is earlier, the premium on earlier options may go up, or vice versa.\n",

The money are sent to IV's account. 3) Scumbag calls IV saying 'Oh, I've made a mistake, blah, blah, yada, yada. Could you please send the money back to me? My bank account is...' 4) Innocent Victim, being the good guy that he/she is, of course want to help out and send the money to Scumbag. 5) Scumbag makes a cash withdrawal and is no longer anywhere to be found and Innocent Victim is left with a loan but no money.\n",

The funds get deposited into UP's account. 3) The crook reaches out to UP, fabricating a story about a mistake, and requests the funds be returned to their bank account. 4) Unaware Party, exhibiting their kind nature, obligingly transfers the money back. 5) The crook extracts the funds as cash and vanishes, resulting in Unaware Party being stuck with a loan but void of cash.\n",

      "Reference Response:  You want to leave your estate assets to your heirs, and you don't want them to be burdened with a huge tax bill. Fortunately, there are many ways to maximize their tax savings through estate planning. If you can reduce your gross estate value to an amount that is lower than the federal threshold for the tax, your heirs can avoid the estate tax. Let's review nine of the best ways to minimize your taxes. 1. Make Charitable Donations, 2. Set Up a Family Limited Partnership, 3. Use the Marital Deduction, 4. Set Up a Trust, 5. Move to a State without Estate Taxes, 6. Give Gifts Instead of Inheritances, 7. Set Up a Donor Advised Fund, 8. Fund a Qualified Personal Residence Trust, 9. Buy an Extra Life Insurance Policy to Pay the Tax.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Desiring to pass on your wealth to your descendants, it is not your intention to leave them struggling under a massive duty fee. Luckily, a multitude of strategies exist to amplify the tax relief possibilities through estate management. You prioritize shrinking your total estate worth to a figure below the nation's tax threshold, thus exempting your benefactors from property transfer taxes. We shall explore six optimal methods to lower your duty fees. These are 1. Donate to Charity, 2. Start a Small Family Business, 3. Utilize the Spouse Allowance, 4. Form a Financial Reserve, 5. Trade assets rather than passing them down, and 6. Purchase an Additional Pension Plan to Cover the Fees. Note, moving to a tax-free province and establishing a monetary advisory fund have also been proven effective, yet they are not included in this list.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Specific stock advice isn't permitted on these boards. I'm discussing the process of a call spread with the Apple Jan 13 calls as an example.  In effect, you have $10 to 'bet.' Each bet you'd construct offers a different return (odds). For example, If you bought the $750 call at $37.25, you'd need to look to find what strike has a bid of $27 or higher. The $790 is bid $27.75. So this particular spread is a 4 to 1 bet the stock will close in January over $790, with a $760 break even.  You can pull the number from Yahoo to a spreadsheet to make your own chart of spread costs, but I'll give one more example.  You think it will go over $850, and that strike is now ask $18.85. The highest strike currently listed is $930, and it's bid $10.35. So this spread cost is $850, and a close over $930 returns $8000 or over 9 to 1.  Again, this is not advice, just an analysis of how spreads work. Note, any anomalies in the pricing above is the effect of a particular strike having no trades today, not every strike is active so 'last trade' can be days old.   Note: My answer adds to AlexR's response in that once you used the word bet and showed a desire to make a risky move, options are the answer. You acknowledged you understand the basic concept, but given the contract size of 100 shares, these suggestions are ways to bet under your $1000 limit and profit from the gain in the underlying stock you hope to see.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  On this forum, we abstain from providing explicit guidance concerning specific stocks. Let's consider the methodology of a call spread citing Apple Jan 13 calls for illustration. Put simply, imagine you have $10 for 'wagering.' The potential yield varies with each wager you frame or devise. For instance, let's say you purchased the $750 call for $37.25, your next goal is to identify which strike has a bid of $27 or above. $27.75 is the bid for the $790. Therefore, this specific spread is effectively a 4 to 1 gamble that the stock will exceed $790 at the closure in January, with a break-even point at $760. You could manually transport numbers from Yahoo onto a spreadsheet for your personalized spread cost graph, but let's walk through another example. Let's assume you predict it will cross over $850, and currently, that strike's asking rate is $18.85. $930 is the peak strike logged at present, its bid standing at $10.35. In this case, the spread expense amounts to $850, and if the closure surpasses $930, the return could possibly be $8000 or more than 9 to 1. Please take this not as advice but rather as a structural analysis of spreads. Bear in mind that any irregularities in the earlier figures occur due to certain strikes not having been traded on a particular day. Therefore, not all strikes are active, and 'last trade' could be stale by several days. On another note, this addition to AlexR's reply helps understand that when you express a willingness to take a risk, options are a viable choice. You've signaled basic comprehension of this concept, but keeping the contract size of 100 shares in mind, these strategies can help you stay within your $1000 limit while reaping benefits from an increase in the stock you're optimistic about.\n",

      "Reference Response:  You must understand that not everyone has or can get credit cards. Consider that those who are in the the lowest 20-30% of income tend to have fewer credit cards (or none), and lower credit debt, although some have quite high credit card debt relative to their income.  So you really aren't comparing the same demographics (the population of all income earners, used to calculate average income, and the population of all credit card debt holders, are not the same groups of people). Once you remove those folks from consideration, then credit card usage may still average higher, but accept that it is unusual for people making less than $20K-30K/year to have much credit card debt. You must understand that wealth and income are two very different (although related) concepts. One must note that there are millions of people in the U.S. who have wealth; they have net assets of over $1M (excluding their homes). Many of those folks have assets greatly exceeding $1M. And although it might seem foolish to carry a large balance on their credit cards, they may have quite low interest rates, and simply find it simpler and more convenient to use credit cards in lieu of personal loans.  Suppose you have $2M in net assets, and want to buy a classic car or a diamond necklace.  Charging $30K and carrying the balance until a dividend check arrives may make sense. Understand also that not everyone makes the same choices, or good choices. Carrying a credit card balance may appear like a poor choice, especially when you are not wealthy, or have lower income. But suppose you have a high credit limit across several cards, and you need to handle a short-term financial challenge (car repair, layoff, medical bills, etc).  You might use the credit card to pay for that purchase, essentially financing an extraordinary event over a longer period of time.  And although having a balance of more than 5-10% of your monthly income may seem foolish to some, it may make sense to others. And some people choose to carry balances of 50% to 100% of their credit limit.  Others realize that keeping their credit utilization below 30%, 20%, or 10% of the credit limit is a better plan (both interest rate and risk wise).\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Appreciate the fact that not everybody has access to credit cards. Individuals who belong to the bottom 20-30% income bracket generally have reduced access to credit cards and tend to bear lesser credit debt. Still, some might possess substantial credit card debt compared to their earnings. This indicates that comparing income demographics with credit card debt demographics might not give accurate results as these are two distinctly different groups. With such individuals removed from the frame, credit card usage might still considerably be above average, yet, it's rather uncommon to find people earning under $20K-30K/year buried under heaps of credit debt. It's important to recognize the difference between wealth and income. Consider there are millions of people in America owning assets above $1M (excluding their primary residences), and a bunch of them possess assets way above this amount. Even though it might be perceived as unsound to maintain a hefty credit balance, these people might enjoy low interest rates, and they might prefer using credit cards over personal loans due to convenience. For instance, someone with $2M worth net assets might want to buy a vintage car or an expensive necklace. Charging $30k on their card and waiting till the dividend cheque arrives might seem like a sensible plan for them. Additionally, remember that not everyone prioritizes similar choices or constructive decisions. Some might view maintaining a credit card balance as poor decision-making, primarily when you're not affluent or earn lesser income. But suppose you have a high credit limit spread across various cards, and you confront a sudden financial crisis (vehicle breakdown, unemployment, hospital expenses etc.), you could resort to utilizing your card to cover those expenses, which essentially allows you to finance that unforeseen event over an extended time frame. And even though having a debt of over 5-10% of your monthly income might seem imprudent to certain individuals, to others it might appear logical. Some might choose to maintain balances equal to 50% to 100% of their credit limit, while others might believe that keeping their credit utilization lower than 30%, 20%, or 10% of the credit limit is a smarter approach given the interest rates and related risks.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Remember that due to inflation you are paying back the loan with cheaper dollars in the future.  If there are no gimmicks in the loan like early payment penalties, or must pay by a certain date or that the credit was for a store that sold the products at a higher price than you could get elsewhere then you are not just getting free money they are paying you to take the money.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Keep in mind, because of deflation, the dollars you're repaying the loan with will be more expensive in the future. Unless there are hidden clauses in the loan, such as penalties for early repayment or a mandatory deadline for payment, or the fact that the loan was taken out from a store selling products at higher prices than elsewhere, you're not merely receiving free cash; the lender is rewarding you to borrow the funds.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Emergency funds have a very specific and obvious benefit; you'll have money sitting around in case you need it.  A lot of people think a big car repair or some unexpected home repair is an emergency, and that's fine.  Emergency also expands up to \"I lost my job four months ago and we're a year in to a recession, the stock market is down 30% and I need to pay my rent or mortgage.\"  Sure, you could just sell some of your stocks that have lost 30% and pay your rent. I know nobody likes to think about it, but the stock market can go down.  I know nobody likes to think about it, but the economy can slink in to a recession.  In fact, here's a small list of recent U.S. recessions: No competent investment adviser would advise that your emergency funds should be subject to market volatility because that completely defeats the purpose of an emergency fund. It's possible that this manager wants you to indicate a separate emergency fund to allocate a portion of your account to a low volatility US Treasury fund or something of the like, this would be materially different than investing in a broad market/large cap fund like VOO or VTI.  The effects of inflation are not so bad that you should put your emergency money in the market.  Who cares what inflation was if you have to sell an asset at a loss to pay rent?  One last point.  Index fund ETFs are not \"safe.\"  Investing in diversified funds is safER than buying individual company stocks.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Rainy day reserves offer a clear and known advantage; spare cash will be available when you require it. Many view unexpected car services or surprise home fixes as emergencies, such a perspective is valid. The term emergency could also refer to events such as losing your job amongst a struggling economy, with the stock market plummeting 30% and rent or mortgage payments are overdue. Granted, you can always liquidate your depreciated stocks to cover your living expenses. It's an unsavory thought, but stock prices can take a hit. Additionally, it's unpleasant to contemplate, but economic downturns can occur. Take for instance, the recent bouts of recessions in the U.S. No proficient financial consultant should suggest subjecting your emergency reserves to market uncertainties, totally undermining the very purpose of such reserves. Maybe this manager aims for you to establish an extra safety net by allotting a part of your account towards a stable US Treasury fund, fundamentally differing from investing in comprehensive market/large cap funds such as VOO or VTI. Inflation impacts are not sufficiently detrimental to warrant risking your emergency cash in the market. What difference does inflation make when an asset needs to be sold at a loss to cover living expenses? One more thing to note, ETFs of Index funds are not infallible. Investing in diverse funds is comparatively safer than purchasing stocks from individual companies.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I'm the contrarian in the crowd. I think credit scores and debt are the closest thing to evil incarnate. You're in good company. The absence of a credit score simply means the agencies have insufficient data in their behavioral model to determine how profitable your business would be to the bank. The higher your score, the more likely the bank is to make a profit from your loan.  IMHO, you're better off building up cash and investment reserves than a credit history. With sufficient reserves,  you will be able to shop around for a bank that will give you a good rate, if you ever do need a loan.  You'll be surprised at how quickly you get in a position where you don't need a loan if you save and invest wisely. I used to have a (high) credit score,  and I was miserable about it because there were always bills due. I gave up debt 14 years ago, paid the last debt 7 years ago, and have never. been happier. Raising kids without debt (or credit score) is much more fun than with debt.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Sometimes, it's okay to be the outlier in the group. I firmly believe that credit ratings and indebtedness are equivalent to the devil in disguise. You're among friends here. Not having a credit score simply indicates that credit agencies don't possess adequate information to measure the possible earnings your enterprise could generate for the bank. The higher your score turns out to be, the greater the bank's profit potential from your loan becomes. In my view, amassing cash and stockpile investments is far preferable to cultivating a credit record. If you accumulate enough reserves, you can scout out banks with attractive rates, in case you find yourself requiring a loan at some point. You'll be astounded by how quickly you can become self-sufficient, without relying on loans, once you start saving and investing judiciously. I once had a stellar credit score and it made me miserable due to the perpetual bills. Fourteen years ago, I bid debt goodbye. I settled my last debt seven years prior, and have never felt more joyous than now. Bringing up children debt-free is a lot more enjoyable than being burdened with debt or maintaining credit ratings.\n",

      "Reference Response:  A mortgage lender will not usually lend more than they could get if they had to repossess the property and sell it to recover their investment (in the U.S. it is generally accepted that 80% of market value is the golden number that makes the mortgage work).  That's why an appraisal is required. Even with 50% down, the numbers might not add up if your property is appraised very low (extremely unlikely, though. It's more likely your realtor is inexperienced).\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Customarily, a loan provider won't typically provide more funds than the potential resale value of the property, should they need to reclaim and sell it to get their funds back (in the U.S., it's often agreed that 80% of the market value is the magic figure that enables the mortgage). Hence, there's a necessity for property evaluation. Even with a hefty 50% initial payment, if your property's appraised value is incredibly low (a rather unlikely scenario), the financials may not align. This is more indicative of a novice real estate agent.\n",

      "Reference Response:  One other consideration is that by paying off your mortgage early versus, for example, investing that capital in a mutual fund is that you are reducing your net liquidity to some degree. That is, if you find yourself needing an emergency infusion of cash it is easier to sell a stock/fund than to sell your house or get a equity loan.  I suppose if you were planning to need a lot of cash to start a business or invest in real estate, then maybe it would make sense to keep your cash more liquid. However, in your situation I agree with Joe. Pay it off. It feels REALLY good to write that last check!\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  An additional factor worth contemplating is the reduction of your overall fluid assets if you choose to settle your house loan ahead of schedule, rather than, for instance, placing the money in an investment fund. In essence, should a sudden fiscal crisis arise, liquidating shares or funds is a simpler process than selling your home or applying for a home equity loan. If your future plans entail a significant monetary requirement for a startup or property investment, it might be wiser to ensure the cash is easily accessible. Nonetheless, given your circumstances, I'm on the same page with Joe. Just pay it off. It's truly satisfying to hand over that final payment!\n",

      "Reference Response:  They don't have to take cash if they reasonably told you in advance they don't take cash, because they made fair effort to prevent you from incurring a debt.  They don't have to take cash if the transaction hasn't yet happened (not a debt) or if it can be easily undone at no cost to either party - such as a newspaper subscription they can just stop delivering.  Both of these reasons are limited by the rules against discrimination, see below.  They don't have to take cash if it's impracticable. For instance a transit bus when fares first went to $1.00, it took years to fund new fareboxes able to take paper money.  You don't have to take a mortgage payment in pennies.  Liquor stores don't have to take $100 bills. (it requires them to keep too much change in the till, which makes them a robbery target).  Trouble arises when it appears there's an ulterior motive for the rule.   Suppose a Landlord Jim requires rent to be paid with EFT.  Rent-controlled Marcie tells the judge \"It's a scheme to oust me, he knows I'm unbanked\".  Jim counters \"No. I got mugged last month because criminals know when I collect cash rents.\"  It will turn on whether Jim can show good-faith effort to work with his unbanked tenants to find other ways to pay. If Jim does a particularly bad job of this, he could find himself paying Marcie's legal bills! Even worse if the ulterior motive is discrimination. Chet the plumber hates Muslims. Alice the feed supplier hates the Amish.  So they decide to take credit cards only, knowing those people's religions don't allow them.  Their goose is cooked once they can't show any other reasonable reason to refuse cash.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  They're not obligated to accept cash if they've adequately informed you beforehand that they won't accept it, as they've taken necessary steps to keep any debt from accruing. If the transaction isn't completed or if it can be easily reversed without cost to anyone involved, they're not forced to accept cash. A prime example is halting the supply of a newspaper subscription. However, these reasons have their bounding set by laws preventing discrimination. Acceptance of cash becomes unnecessary if it's not feasible. For example, when bus fares first rose to a dollar, it took a while before new fareboxes capable of accepting paper money were installed. It's not compulsory to accept penny payments for mortgages. Liquor shops aren't mandated to accept hundred dollar notes due to risk of theft from keeping excessive change. Matters get complicated when there appears to be a hidden agenda for imposing certain payment rules. Imagine landlord Jim insisting on EFT for rent. His rent-controlled tenant Marcie insinuates in court that it's a trick to evict her since she doesn't have a bank. Jim retorts that he'd been robbed after collecting cash rents. A significant factor would be Jim's effort in cooperating with unbanked tenants to find alternative payment methods. If Jim handles this poorly, he may end up covering Marcie's legal charges! The situation takes a serious turn if discrimination is the underlying motivation. For instance, Chet the plumber dislikes Muslims, while Alice the feed supplier has a problem with Amish people. So, they opt for credit card payments only, fully aware that those demographics' religious beliefs prohibit them from using them. If they fail to provide a reasonable explanation to refuse cash, they can find themselves in deep trouble.\n",

Since you haven't been only your own policy lately, it will cost you more than someone with a 3 year history with a perfect record, but if you shop around, you will find something at a fair price.   Also, your credit score often factors into the price you pay for car insurance also.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Sure! Anything that affects the balance of supply and demand could cause rent prices to fall. I'll betcha rent prices in Wilmington, Ohio collapsed when the biggest employer, DHL, shut down. An economic depression of any sort would cause people to substitute expensive rentals for cheaper ones, putting downward pressure on rents. It would also cause people to double up or move in with family, decreasing demand for rentals. Anything that makes buying a house cheaper will actually make rents lower, too, because more people will buy houses when houses get cheaper... those people are moving out of rentals, thus decreasing demand for rentals.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Indeed! Any circumstance that impacts the equilibrium of necessity and availability might plummet rent costs. I've got a hunch that rental rates in Wilmington, Ohio took a nosedive when the mammoth company, DHL, ceased operations. Any form of fiscal crisis would drive individuals to swap high-end leases for more budget-friendly options, hence exerting a downwards force on rental charges. It'd additionally lead folks to share living spaces or rejoin with kin, scaling down the need for lease agreements. On the other hand, any factors that make home purchases more affordable eventually reduce rentals as well, because an increased number of people will opt for property ownership when it becomes more economical...those individuals would be transitioning away from rentals, consequentially diminishing the rental market demand.\n",

So for example if you took money that could have gone to student loans and poured it into other debt, then for some reason declared bankruptcy later, your student load debt would remain while other debt would be discharged; essentially that money would have been better spent on the student loan. This isn't to advocate that you should pay down student loans with the intent of declaring bankruptcy, or that this makes it a better decision necessarily, just a factor that is sometimes forgotten.\n",

      "Reference Response:  First, check out some of the answers on this question: Oversimplify it for me: the correct order of investing When you have determined that you are ready to invest for retirement, there are two things you need to consider: the investment and the account.  These are separate items. The investment is what makes your money grow. The type of account provides tax advantages (and restrictions).  Generally, these can be considered separately; for the most part, you can do any type of investment in any account. Briefly, here is an overview of some of the main options: In your situation, the Roth IRA is what I would recommend. This grows tax free, and if you need the funds for some reason, you can get out what you put in without penalty. You can invest up to $5500 in your Roth IRA each year. In addition to the above reasons, which are true for anybody, a Roth IRA would be especially beneficial for you for three reasons: For someone that is closer in age to retirement and in a higher tax bracket now, a Roth IRA is less attractive than it is for you. Inside your Roth IRA, there are lots of choices. You can invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds (which are simply collections of stocks and bonds), bank accounts, precious metals, and many other things. Discussing all of these investments in one answer is too broad, but my recommendation is this: If you are investing for retirement, you should be investing in the stock market. However, picking individual stocks is too risky; you need to be diversified in a lot of stocks. Stock mutual funds are a great way to invest in the stock market.  There are lots of different types of stock mutual funds with different strategies and expenses associated with them. Managed funds actively buy and sell different stocks inside them, but have high expenses to pay the managers. Index funds buy and hold a list of stocks, and have very low expenses. The conventional wisdom is that, in general, index funds perform better than managed funds when you take the expenses into account.  I hope this overview and these recommendations were helpful. If you have any specific questions about any of these types of accounts or investments, feel free to ask another question.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Initially, take a glance at queries related to this: Simplify it to the bare minimum: the appropriate sequence for investing. Once your readiness for retirement investment is established, you must regard two important elements: the investment itself and the corresponding account. Both are distinct entities. The growth of your funds relies on the investment. The account type offers benefits concerning taxation (and constraints). In most cases, these are separate considerations; you can usually operate any investment through any account. Here are some primary choices to briefly consider: In the context of your circumstance, a Roth IRA is highly suggested. It blossoms tax-free, allowing you to withdraw your original contribution without penalties if needed. A yearly investment of up to $5500 can be made in your Roth IRA. In addition to the advantages applicable to everyone, a Roth IRA is particularly advantageous for you due to the following two reasons: For another individual nearing retirement age and currently in a higher tax bracket, a Roth IRA is not as tempting as it is to you. Inside your Roth IRA, a myriad of options exists. Your investment could be in anything from stocks, bonds, mutual funds, which simply contain stocks and bonds, bank accounts, or even precious metals. Covering all the possible investments in one reply is too much to take in, but my suggestion is: If investing for retirement is your goal, the stock market is the way to go. However, avoid the risk of hand-picking individual stocks; diversification among many stocks is key. Stock mutual funds offer a fantastic method of investing in the stock market. Various types of stock mutual funds exist with different approaches and corresponding expenses. Managed funds that actively manage the stocks within have higher expenses due to management costs. Index funds, with lower expenses, simply purchase a list of stocks and hold onto them. The typical belief is that when expenses are considered, index funds perform better than managed funds in the long run. I trust that you found this summary and the recommendations beneficial. For any specific queries about these accounts or investments, don't hesitate to ask another question.\n",

For   what that's worth at current gold   prices, you could buy all -- not some   -- all of the farmland in the United States.

Furthermore, you could acquire ten enterprises the size of Exxon Mobil, and still, have a trillion dollars for pocket change. Alternatively, you can opt to possess a massive cube of metal. What do you think will yield greater returns? However, it's crucial to note that the cube won't include any platinum, and some of America's farmland might not be available for purchase.\n",

      "Reference Response:  How is it possible for the average investor to underperform the market? The \"average\" investor probably makes some bad decisions. You also might need to take transaction costs into play (including borrowing on margin), so that there's a natural \"erosion\" of returns across the market.  Meaning if transaction/borrowing costs are 1%, and the market return is 5%, the \"average investor\"  Alternatively, if by \"average\" they mean the average of the population, not weighted by amount, it's plausible that the mass of smaller investors perform slightly worse than the smaller number of large investors (and have larger relative transaction costs), thus having a lower average on a per-capita basis. Doesn't the fact that investors can consistently underperform the market by making poor decisions, imply that an investor could consistently outperform the market by making the opposite decisions? No.  If my investment decisions cause me to earn only a 10% return compared to the \"average\" 12% return, then making the opposite decision will cause me to lose 10%, not to make 14%.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  How can an ordinary trader invariably stay behind the market achievements? The typical trader tends to engage in unfavorable judgment calls. Consideration should also be given to factors such as operational expenditures, taking into account leveraging, therefore leading to a gradual dilution of profits in the marketplace. For instance, if these expenses amount to 1%, while the market yields 5%, the ordinary trader may end up underperforming. Conversely, if we think of \"ordinary\" as the population mean, discounting the investment volume, it's feasible that the bulk of smaller traders fare slightly poorer compared to the handful of large-scale traders (with proportionately higher transactional expenses), hence reducing the average on a per head basis. Doesn't it indicate that if a trader continually underachieves in the market due to errant decisions, then the opposite actions could allow an investor to consistently surpass the market? Not quite. If my financial calls only allow me a 10% return against the typical 12% return, then an opposite action will result in a 10% loss, not a 14% gain.\n",

      "Reference Response:  For simplicity, let's start by just considering cash back. In general, cash back from credit cards for personal use is not taxable, but for business use it is taxable (sort of, I'll explain later). The reason is most personal purchases are made with after tax dollars; you typically aren't deducting the cost of what you purchased from your personal income, so if you purchase something that costs $100 and you receive $2 back from the CC company, effectively you have paid $98 for that item but that wouldn't affect your tax bill. However, since businesses typically deduct most expenses, that same $100 deduction would have only been a $98 deduction for business tax purposes, so in this case the $2 should be accounted for. Note, you should not consider that $2 as income though; that would artificially inflate your revenue. It should be treated as a negative expense, similar to how you would handle returning an item you purchased and receiving a CC refund. Now for your specific questions: Part 1: As a small business owner, I wish to attend an annual seminar to improve my business. I have enough credit card reward points to cover the airfare, hotel, and rental car. Will those expenses still be deductible at the value displayed on the receipt? Effectively no, these expenses are not deductible. If you deduct them they will be completely counter-acted by the \"refund\" you receive for the payments. Part 2: Does it matter if those points are accrued on my personal credit card, rather than a business credit card? This is where it gets hairy. Suppose your company policy is that employees make purchases with their own personal credit cards and submit receipts for reimbursement. In this case the employer can simply reimburse and would not know or care if the employee is racking up rewards/points/cashback. The trick is, as the employee, you must always purchase business related items normally so you have receipts to show, and if you receive cashback on the side there seems to be a \"don't ask, don't tell\" rule that the IRS is OK with. It works the same way with heavy business travelers and airline miles- the free vacations those users get as perks are not treated as taxable income. However, I would not go out of my way to abuse this \"loophole\". Typically, things like travel (airfare, hotel, car rental, meals) are expected. But I wouldn't go purchase 100 company laptops on your personal card and ask the company to reimburse you. The company should purchase those 100 laptops on a company card and effectively reduce the sale price by the cashback received. (Or more realistically, negotiate a better discount with your account rep and just cut them a check.) Part 3: Would there be any difference between credit card points and brand-loyalty points? If the rental car were paid for with points earned directly on the rental car company's loyalty system (not a CC), would that yield a different result? There is no difference. Perhaps the simplest way to think about this is you can only deduct an expense that you actually incur. In other words, the expense should show up on a bank or CC statement. This is why when you volunteer and work 10 hours for a charity, you can't call that a \"donation\" of any amount of money because there is no actual payment made that would show up on a bank statement. Instead you could have billed the charity for your 10 hours of work, and then turned around and donated that same amount back to them, but it ends up being a wash.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Let's start with a basic concept like cash back. Ordinary cash returns from credit cards used for personal purposes are generally non-taxable while those used for business purposes are taxable (I will elaborate on this later). This primarily hinges on the fact that personal expenditures are usually met with post-tax dollars; typically, what you buy doesn't get deducted from your personal income. Hence, if you spend $100 on something and the credit card company gives you $2 back, you effectively spend $98 on the item without any changes to your taxes. Conversely, businesses mostly deduct expenses so that $100 deducted would essentially be $98 in terms of business tax, necessitating the $2 to be accounted for. Be mindful to not classify this $2 as income, which would inaccurately raise your revenue. It should be treated as a reverse expense, much like when you return an item bought and get a credit card refund. To address your specific queries: First one, being a small business owner, you plan to participate in an annual seminar for bettering your business. Your credit card reward points are sufficient for all costs including flight, accommodation, and car hire. Can these expenses still be claimed as deductions based on the receipt's stated value? In effect, no, as these expenditures are not deductible. Deducting them would essentially be null and void due to the \"refund\" from the payment. Secondly, does it make a difference if these points are accumulated on a personal instead of a business credit card? This is convolution personified. Let's say your company’s way of operation permits employees to use their private credit cards for purchases and they seek reimbursement based upon receipts. Here the boss can reimburse without worrying if the staff member is secretly amassing rewards/points/cashbacks. The trick as an employee is to always buy business-related goods in the normal way to provide receipts, but as far as side benefits like cashbacks, let's just say IRS has adopted a “see no evil, hear no evil” policy. High-flying business travellers and their airline miles share the same rule – vacations earned as perks are not seen as taxable income. However, do try to avoid exploiting this \"loophole\". Regular travel expenses, things like flights, hotels, car hires, meals, are expected. Do not buy hundreds of company laptops with your private card and then request reimbursement for the whole lot. Use the company card to buy these hundred laptops and effectively reduce the sale price using the cashback received. (Better still, work out a lucrative discount with your account representative and simply pay them via cheque.) And the last part, is there a gap between credit card points and brand-loyalty points? If the points earned directly from the car rental company (and not from a credit card) were used, would that yield a different outcome? The answer is no, there's no difference. A quick and easy way to get your head around this is to understand that you can only claim expenses you've actually run up. That is to say, the expenses should appear on a bank or credit card statement. Work done as a volunteer, for example, for 10 hours for a charity can't be regarded as a \"donation\" because no actual payment is involved that would show up on a bank statement. A more viable method is to bill a charity for your 10 hours of work and then give the same amount back to the charity in the form of a donation, but it becomes a draw.\n",

It has been adopted by companies which are not banks but wish to appear as such, and satisfy legal restrictions on the usage of the word bank. ... For instance, if the original company is known as Bank of America, then the new investment banking entity may be known as Banc of America Securities LLC. If the original company is known as Bank of Manhattan, then its insurance business might be known as \"Banc of Manhattan Insurance\" and its holding company might be called \"Manhattan Bancorp\". This practice originates from legal necessity: Under the laws of most states, a corporation may only use the word \"bank\" in its name if it has obtained a banking charter under state or federal banking laws. So, \"Banc of America\" is the subsidiary of BoA that doesn't have appropriate licenses to be called \"bank\". Wonders of complex regulation :)\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The term Banq (alternatively known as Banc, banc-corp, bancorp, or bancorporation) is a deliberate misspelling of the term 'bank’. Adopted by businesses that aren't actually banks, but want to project that image while overstepping legal limits on using the term 'bank'. For illustration, if there's a company by the name Bank of America, its investment banking department could be named Banc of America Securities LLC. A company called Bank of Manhattan may dub its insurance division as \"Banc of Manhattan Insurance\" and its parent company might be dubbed \"Manhattan Bancorp\". The origins of this trend are rooted in a legal requirement: According to most state laws, only businesses that have procured a state or federal banking charter can use \"bank\" in its title. Therefore, \"Banc of America\" is a subsidiary of BoA that doesn't have the required license to be titled \"bank\". Welcome to the complexities of regulation!\n",

      "Reference Response:  The reason to put more money down or accept a shorter maximum term is because the bank sweetens the deal (or fails to sour it in some fashion).  For example, typically, if there is less than 20% down, you have to pay an premium called \"Private Mortgage Insurance\", which makes it bad deal. But I see banks offering the same rate for a 15%-year mortgage as for a 30-year one, and I think: fools and their money.  Take the 30-year and, if you feel like it pay more every month.  Although why you would feel like it, I don't know, since it's very difficult to get that money back if you need it.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The rationale behind increasing your down payment or settling for a lesser overall duration is because financial institutions make the offer more enticing (or avoid making it unappealing in some way). Usually, when the down payment is less than a fifth of the price, you will incur an extra charge labeled \"Private Mortgage Insurance\", which isn't a good transaction to partake in. However, I have observed banks proposing a consistent interest rate for a 15-year mortgage that is equivalent to a 30-year one, which leads me to reflect on the wastefulness of money. Opt for the 30-year plan, and, if you're inclined, give more on a monthly basis. Then again, I'm not sure why one would, as it's exceedingly challenging to retrieve those funds when there's a necessity for it.\n",

      "Reference Response:  For the vast majority, \"buying\" a house via a mortgage is not an investment.  I use quotes around buying because from a technical perspective you don't own anything until you've paid it off; this is often an important point that people forget. It's highly unlikely you'll make more on it than the amount you put into it (interest, repairs, etc).  Even with relatively low interest rates. The people who successfully invest in homes are those that use actual cash (not borrowed) to buy a home at well below market value.  They then clean it up and make enough repairs to make it marketable and sell it shortly there after.  Sometimes these people get hosed if the housing market tumbles to the point that the home is now worth less than the amount they put into it.  This is especially problematic if they used bank loans to get the process going.  They were actually the hardest hit when the housing bubble popped several years ago.  Well, them and the people who bought on interest only loans or had balloon payments. Whereas the people who use a mortgage are essentially treating it like a bank account with a negative interest rate.  For example, $180k loan on a 30 yr fixed at 4% will mean a total payout of around $310k, excluding normal repairs like roofs, carpet, etc.  Due to how mortgage's work, most of the interest is collected during the first half of the loan period.  So selling it within 2 to 5 years is usually problematic unless the local housing market has really skyrocketed. Housing markets move up and down all the time due to a hundred different things completely out of your control.  It might be a regional depression, weather events, failed large businesses, failed city/local governments, etc.  It could go up because businesses moved in, a new highway is built, state/local taxes decline, etc. My point is, homes are not long term investments.  They can be short term ones, but only in limited circumstances and there is a high degree of risk involved.  So don't let that be a driving point of your decision. Instead you need to focus on other factors.  Such as: what is really going on with the house you are currently in?  Why would they lose it?  Can you help out, and, should you help out?  If things are precarious, it might make more sense to sell that home now and everyone move into separate locations, possibly different rentals or apartments.  If they are foreclosed on then they will be in a world of financial hurt for a long time. If we ignore your parents situation, then one piece of advice I would give you is this: Rent the cheapest apartment you can find that is still a \"safe\" place to live in.  Put every dollar you can into some type of savings/investment that will actually grow.  Stay there for 5+ years, then go pay cash for a nice home.  Making $75k a year while single means that you don't need much to live on.  In other words, live extremely cheap now so you can enjoy a fantastic living experience later that is free from financial fear.  You should be able to put $30k+ per year aside going this route. edit: A bit of support data for those that somehow think buying a home on a mortgage is somehow a good investment:   Robert Shiller, who won a Nobel prize in economics and who predicted the bursting of the housing bubble, has shown that a house is not a good investment.  Why?  First, home prices (adjusted for inflation) have been virtually unchanged for the past 100 years.  (link 1, link 2)  Second, after you add in the costs of maintenance alone then those costs plus what you've paid for the home will exceed what you get out of it.  Adding in the cost of a mortgage could easily double or even triple the price you paid which makes things even worse.  Maintenance costs include things like a new roof, carpet/flooring, water heater, appliances, etc. Yes, a home might cost you $100k and you might sell it for $200k after 15 years.  However during that time you'll likely replace the roof ($10k to $20k), replace appliances ($2k to $5k), water heater ($1k), carpet/flooring ($5k to $20k), paint ($3k to $6k), and mortgage related costs (~$60k - assuming 30 yr fixed @4%).  So your \"costs\" are between $180k and $200k just on those items.  There are many more that could easily escalate the costs further.  Like a fence ($5k+), air conditioner ($5k+), windows, etc. The above is assuming the home actually appreciates in value faster than inflation: which they historically haven't over the long term.   So you have to consider all of the costs ultimately paid to purchase and maintain the home vs the costs of renting during the same time period.   Point is: do your research and be realistic about it.  Buying a home is a huge financial risk.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Purchasing a home through a mortgage is in most cases not a worthwhile investment, despite common misconceptions. Many overlook the fact that until the mortgage is fully paid, the house truly isn't theirs. The returns you get from a house are unlikely to compensate for the resources you've invested into it; even in the context of low interest rates. The successful home investors are those who spend their own money to purchase below-market-value houses, renovate them, and sell for profit. But if the housing market drops significantly, these investments can be counterproductive, especially with bank loans involved. This risk was widely seen during the housing bubble burst. Similarly, those who bought with interest-only loans or had balloon payments fell into the same trap. \n",
      "\n",
      "When you analyze it, taking out a mortgage is like depositing money into an account with a negative interest rate. For instance, a $180k loan on a 30 year term at 4% interest will eventually cost you approximately $310k, excluding other costs such as repairs. Selling within the first few years of the mortgage can be financially tricky unless the local housing market has had a significant increase. The volatility of the housing market is influenced by many uncontrollable factors. \n",
      "\n",
      "Houses, therefore, shouldn't be seen as long-term investments. There can be short term benefits, but they come with a risk. Instead of focusing on the potential investment return from a house, it's wiser to consider your current living situation and what would be best for your financial health. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ignoring your parents' situation, my advice is to find the cheapest, safe rental you can, and save as much as possible. If you are single and earn $75k a year, your living expenses should be low. In five or more years, you could then buy a good house outright, having lived frugally and saved sufficiently is the best strategy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Robert Shiller, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, illustrates through research that home investment isn't as lucrative as most people think. The prices of homes, adjusted for inflation, have remained virtually the same over the past century. After factoring in the costs of maintenance and mortgage payments, you usually spend more on the house than it's worth at resale. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, you might sell a $100k house for $200k after 15 years, but during those years, you're likely to spend between $180k-$200k on maintenance and mortgage-related costs. This is assuming that your house's value increases faster than inflation. Therefore, consider the overall costs associated with owning and maintaining a home versus renting before buying. Do thorough research and be pragmatic. Buying a house carries substantial financial risks.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Yes, stock price is determined by the last trade price. There are always going to be people who have put in a price to buy a stock (called a bid price) and people who have put in a price to sell a stock (called an ask price). Based on your example, if the last trade price for the stock was $1.23, then you might have the following bid prices and ask prices: So if you put in a limit order to buy 100 shares at $100, you would buy the 40 shares at $1.23, the 15 shares at $1.24, and the 45 shares $1.25.  The price of the stock would go up to $1.25. Conversely, if you put in a limit order to sell 100 shares at $0.01 (I don't think any broker would allow a sell price of $0.00), you would sell 30 shares at $1.22, 20 shares at $1.21, and 50 shares at $1.20.  The price of the stock would go down to $1.20.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Surely, the last trade mediates the value of stocks. There will always be individuals who make an offer to purchase a stock (termed as a purchase price) and individuals who set a price for selling their stock (known as a sale price). Referring to your illustration, if the final transaction for the stock stood at $1.23, you might encounter the subsequent purchase and sale prices: So, if you set a boundary order for acquiring 100 stocks at $100, your purchases would include 40 stocks at $1.23, 15 stocks at $1.24, and finalize with 45 stocks at $1.25. Consequently, the stock's price elevates to $1.25. Alternatively, if you place a boundary order to vend 100 stocks at $0.01 (I doubt the broker would accommodate a sale price of $0.00), your sale would encompass 30 stocks at $1.22, 20 stocks at $1.21, and finalize with 50 stocks at $1.20. This action would plunge the stock's price to $1.20. With the upcoming bull race, we can reasonably expect Nike stocks to surge, reaching possibly even $200 by the end of next quarter.\n",

Only you as an individual know about your personal situation and can therefore claim these deductions and credits by filing income tax returns. 2- Me telling you that you made $100,000 last year is not the same as telling you that you made $125,000 last year, but someone took $25,000 out of your pocket. Tax season is the one time of the year when citizens know exactly what chunk of their hard earned money was taken by the government, creating more collective awareness about taxation and giving politicians a harder time when they propose raising taxes.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  There are two key points to consider: Firstly, individuals are the ones with exhaustive knowledge about their personal circumstances, enabling them to claim deductions or credits unknown to their employers during tax filing season. Secondly, the act of revealing that you've earned $100,000 in one year doesn't convey the same context as saying you earned $125,000, but $25,000 mysteriously disappeared. Tax season is an annual episode which underscores how much we actually contribute to the state coffers, making it harder for politicians to casually suggest tax increases due to the heightened public awareness and scrutiny. While this covers part of the original message, it introduces a slight off-gist element by suggesting that $25,000 mysteriously disappeared, a sentiment not expressed in the original text.\n",

Live in the cheapest available housing (that is reasonably safe).  Have no social life.  Wake up, work, class, eat, work, study, sleep. Every day.  Don't eat at restaurants.  Eat only simple meals at home.   Every meal.  Have a car payment?  Get rid of your car and use public transit or get the cheapest running car possible.   One year of nothing but focused effort on paying for and finishing school.  If you can't earn enough to cover 14K on top of your basic living expenses, then you aren't working hard enough, or you have extenuating circumstances that make finishing your degree at this time infeasible.\n",

Your daily routine should include waking up, work duties, attending class, eating, more work, study time, and then sleep. Stay away from eating out at restaurants, limit yourself to homemade, simple meals each time. If you're burdened with a car payment, think about giving up your vehicle for public commute or alternatively, look for the most affordable functioning car. Dedicate an entire year to strict emphasis on financing and completing your education. If you're unable to make an extra $14K to account for your basic necessities, perhaps you're not exerting ample efforts, or maybe there are unexpected circumstances restricting you from completing your degree at the moment.\n",

      "Reference Response:  As the other answers suggest, there are a number of ways of going about it and the correct one will be dependent on your situation (amount of equity in your current house, cashflow primarily, amount of time between purchase and sale). If you have a fair amount of equity (for example, $50K mortgage remaining on a house valued at $300K), I'll propose an option that's similar to bridge financing: Place an offer on your new house. Use some of your equity as part of the down payment (eg, $130K). Use some more of your equity as a cash buffer to allow you pay two mortgages in between the purchase and the sale (eg, $30K). The way this would be executed is that your existing mortgage would be discharged and replaced with larger mortgage. The proceeds of that mortgage would be split between the down payment and cash as you desire. Between the closing of your purchase and the closing of your sale, you'll be paying two mortgages and you'll be responsible for two properties. Not fun, but your cash buffer is there to sustain you through this. When the sale of your new home closes, you'll be breaking the mortgage on that house. When you get the proceeds of the sale, it would be a good time to use any lump sum/prepayment privileges you have on the mortgage of the new house.  You'll be paying legal fees for each transaction and penalties for each mortgage you break. However, the interest rates will be lower than bridge financing. For this reason, this approach will likely be cheaper than bridge financing only if the time between the closing of the two deals is fairly long (eg, at least 6 months), and the penalties for breaking mortgages are reasonable (eg, 3 months interest). You would need the help of a good mortgage broker and a good lawyer, but you would also have to do your own due diligence - remember that brokers receive a commission for each mortgage they sell. If you won't have any problems selling your current house quickly, bridge financing is likely a better deal. If you need to hold on to it for a while because you need to fix things up or it will be harder to sell, you can consider this approach.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  As suggested by various responses, multiple strategies exist and choosing the right one mainly relies on your circumstances (equity in your present home, primary cash flow, the time frame between buying and selling). Suppose your equity is considerable (for instance, $50K remaining mortgage on a $300K valued house), let me put forth a variant of bridge financing: Make a bid on the new property. Utilize a part of your equity for the down payment (say, $130K). You may use additional equity as cash cushion for covering two mortgages during the buying and selling period (say, $30K). Practically, your current mortgage would be dismissed and superseded with a bigger one. The received loan is divided between the down payment and cash as needed. During the settlement of your buying and selling, you'll be accountable for two properties and their associated mortgage expenses. Certainly not an easy ride, but the cash cushion will ensure survival. When the new home selling concludes, you'll terminate its mortgage. The sale proceeds can be ideally used to prepay the new house's mortgage in lump sum if permissible. Legal fees are applicable for each action and penalties are imposed for every mortgage termination. However, the interest costs would be lesser than bridge financing. Hence this method would be cost-effective compared to bridge financing only if the gap between the two deals' completion is significantly long (at least 6 months), and the mortgage termination charges are modest (say, 3 months interest). A proficient mortgage broker and a legal advisor would be beneficial but personal diligence is necessary - bear in mind that brokers earn commissions from mortgage sales. If selling your current home swiftly is not an issue, bridge financing could be a viable option. If you must retain it due to repair needs or selling complications, this strategy is worth considering. This method cost-effectively helps manage the financial burden as the new property's mortgage rates would be higher since they would include the cost of redecorating your current house.\n",

Options, for example, use current price, cost of money, and volatility among other factors to price the chance of an underlying asset reaching a certain price in a certain timeframe.  A graphical forecast simply puts these calculations into a visual format.

With stocks, on the other hand, models try to simulate real life and many factors can't be accounted for.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Multiple methods are accessible for determining the likelihood of a specific result.

These computations are visually represented via a schematic prediction. It seems, from your provided image, it demonstrates the previous forecast as well as the subsequent performance of the shares.

      "Reference Response:  Disputing the remark seems unlikely to move your score, since it is just that -- a remark.  It's hard to say whether the scoring models can/do read the remarks and incorporate them (somehow) into the scoring metric itself. Disputing the revolving account that should be reported as closed is a different matter.  The question there would be what the status of that account is/was.  In other words, is it showing as an open collection or some other status which would indicate the creditor still has a pending claim?  If so, disputing it might have some effect, although nobody would be able to tell you for certain or even how much your score might be affected. If, as you say, that account should have been part of the bankruptcy package then getting that corrected could be important enough to achieve what you're looking for.  You can try it and see, but even if the effect is minor, you still want your credit report to be a true reflection of the facts. I hope this helps. Good luck!\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Arguing a comment may not impact your rating, given it's merely a comment. It's unclear if scoring models factor the comments in, in any form, into the rating matrix. However, contesting a revolving account that's supposed to be recorded as closed is another story altogether. The point of contention here would be the existing status of the account. In simpler terms, is the account perceived as an open claim or hinting towards the lender having an outstanding claim? If this is the case, a dispute might make a difference, but no one could assure you if or how much it could alter your score. If, as per your assertion, the account was meant to be part of the bankruptcy agreement, then rectifying it may align with your goal. You could give it a shot, and even if the effect is small, you'd still prefer an accurate depiction of your financial history in your credit report. Here's to hoping this proves helpful. All the best!\n",

      "Reference Response:  Utilization is near real-time. What that means is that what is reported is what is taken in terms of debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. When a mortgage broker pulls your credit, they will pull the latest balances with the minimum payments. This is what is taken to determine DTI along with your gross monthly income. If you do not pay your account in full before the statement date, then you more than likely will have to wait an additional statement cycle before it reports to the credit bureaus. Therefore, your utilization is dynamic and the history of your utilization month-to-month is not recorded forever. Only the current balance. What is maintained and reported is your payment history. So you want to never be late if you want to be approved anytime soon for a mortgage. A lower DTI will not help your interest rate. As long as you stay away from the maximum DTI for the mortgage vehicle you are attempting to be approved for (VA, FHA, Conventional, etc), then your DTI should not be a concern. If you are borderline at the time of underwriting, you can take the opportunity and pay off the balances. The mortgage company can then do what is called a credit supplement which entails contacting those lenders where you have proven you have a zero balance and manually input the zero balance cards, that have not yet reported to the bureaus, in your final application to the mortgage company for underwriting approval.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Usage is almost immediate, meaning the reported information relates to the current debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. When a loan agent examines your credit history, they look at the latest amounts along with the least payment requirements. This influences your DTI calculation together with your total monthly earnings. If an account is not completely cleared before the statement's due date, one possibly may need to wait for another bill cycle for it to reflect on the credit reports. Hence, the usage is in flux, and the monthly usage history isn't retained permanently - only the present balance. The kept and reported data is your transaction record. Avoiding delay in payments is necessary if you want to secure a mortgage sooner rather than later. A decreased DTI won't improve your interest rates. Just ensure to keep your DTI lower than the permitted maximum for the type of mortgage you're seeking (Veteran Affairs, Federal Housing Administration, Conventional, and so forth). If your DTI is on the verge at the point of underwriting, you could attempt to clear all outstanding balances. A mortgage company could orchestrate a credit enhancement, which entails reaching out to those creditors that can verify your zero balance and manually updating those zero balance cards yet to be reported to credit reports, into your final mortgage company application for underwriting consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "New Information: If an account is not completely cleared before the statement's due date, one possibly may need to pay a penalty on overdue payments. DTI value helps in evaluating an individual's financial stability for creditors and plays a significant role in deciding the limit of your credit card. This information from the credit report is beneficial as it allows financial institutions to have a quick yet comprehensive understanding of the individual's credit risk level.\n",

      "Reference Response:  If there are a lot of houses for sale, can you be sure that in a year or two you can sell yours? How long does the average house in that area stay on the market before it is sold? What percentage of houses never get sold?  If it can't be sold due to the crowded market you will be forced to rent the house. The question for you then is how much rental income can you get? Compare the rental income to your monthly cost of owning, and managing the house.  One benefit to buying a house in a market that is easy to rent a house would be if you are forced to move quickly, then you aren't stuck being 3 months into a 12 month lease.  Keep in mind that markets can change rather dramatically in just a few years. Housing costs were flat for much of the 90's, then rocketed up in the first half of the last decade, and after a big drop, they are one a slow climb back up. But the actual path they are on depends on the part of the US you are in.  The rule of thumb in the past was based on the fact that over a few years the price would rise enough overcome the closing costs on the two transactions. Unfortunately the slow growth in the 90's meant that many had to bring checks to closing because the equity gained wasn't enough to overcome the closing costs due to low down payment loans.   The fast growth period meant that people got into exotic loans to maximize the potential income when prices were going up 10-20% a year.  When prices dropped some found that they bought houses they couldn't afford, but couldn't sell to break even on the transaction. They were stuck and had to default on the mortgage.  In fact I have never seen a time frame when the rule of thumb ever applied.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Should you be certain of selling your home among many others in the market within two years? How long does a typical house in that region remain unsold? What fraction of homes never find an owner? If an oversaturated market prevents a sale, you'll need to lease it out. Then, your concern becomes the potential income from renting the home. Evaluate this income against your monthly expenses for maintaining and owning the home. An advantage of investing in a rental-friendly market is if you need to relocate swiftly, you aren't trapped mid-way through a yearly lease. Remember, housing markets can undergo substantial transformations within a handful of years. Although the 90's witnessed stagnant price levels before a significant rise early in the new millennium followed by a drop and a slow recovery, the actual progression is dependent on the US region. In the past, it was anticipated that the price would inflate enough over a few years to offset the closing costs in two transactions. The sluggish growth in the '90s, however, meant that many had to pay out of pocket at closing, as the capital gained failed to balance the closing expenses due to low deposit loans. During times of rapid growth, many opted for unconventional loans to tap into possible revenues when prices were skyrocketing by 10-20% annually. But, when prices fell, some realized they'd invested in properties they couldn't afford and couldn't sell without absorbing a loss. They found themselves cornered and defaulted on their mortgage. Notably, I can't recall a time when this rule of thumb ever held true.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Imagine that your normal mode of using credit gets you a score of X. As time goes by your score trends upward if the positive items (length of credit) outweigh your negative items. But there are no big increases or decrease in your score. Then you make a one time change to how you use credit. If this is a event that helps your score, there will be a increase in your score. If it is bad thing your score will drop. But if you go back to your standard method of operating your score will drift back to the previous range. Getting a car loan for a few months to get a bump in your credit score, will not sustain your score at the new level indefinitely. Overtime the impact will lessen, and the score will return your your normal range. Spending money on the loan just to buy a temporary higher credit score is throwing away money.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Envision that your typical method of utilizing credit results in a rating of X. Over time, if the positive factors like duration of credit surpass negative ones, your score gradually improves. There won't be any significant surge or dip in your rating. However, if you alter your credit use once, a positive change will elevate your score, while a negative event will devalue it. If you revert to your regular handling, your score will slowly approach the previous span. Obtaining a vehicle loan momentarily in order to inflate your credit score isn't a long term solution. The immediate effect will dwindle eventually, causing your score to recede back to its original realm. Hence, incurring a loan to just momentarily push your score up is a mere waste of resources.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Okay so I am going to break this answer into a couple sections: Okay so first things first. Did you get a good deal? This is challenging to answer for a number of reasons. First, a good deal is relative to the buyers goals. If you're attempting to buy an asset that provides passive income then maybe you met your goal and got a good deal. If you're attempting to buy an asset that provides long term growth, and you purchased above market (I'm speculating of course) then you may have made a bad deal. So how do you determine if you got a good deal? Does your \"Gross Rental Multiplier\" equal that or is less than that of the average GRM in your area. The lower the better.  So how do you use the GRM to determine if you're getting a good deal? Divide your purchase price by the average city (or area) GRM and that will tell you what you should be getting annually in rent.  You can also use the GRM to determine if a future purchase is over or under priced. Just replace purchase price with asking price.  Alright, so these are the tools you can use to decide if you made a bad business deal or not. There are many ways to skin a cat so to speak. These are the tools I use BEFORE I purchase a home. Many people are penny wise and pound foolish. Take your time when making large purchases. It's OKAY to say PASS.  Okay next thing is this new purchase you're looking at. The number one rule when working a franchise is you don't open a second store until you have a perfect working model to go off of. If you've never had to file a tax return for your current rental. Then you need to wait. If you've never read your local and state rental laws. Then you need to WAIT. If you've never had to leave an event early, wake up in the middle of the night, or get a text while you're on a date from one of your tenants. THEN YOU NEED TO WAIT. Give it a year or two. Just learn the unknown about rental properties. Use your first as your test bed. It's WAY more cheaper then if you make a bad mistake and roll it over multiple properties.  Finally I will leave you with this. No one on this site, myself included, knows everything there is to know about real estate. Anyone that claims they do, send their ass packing. This is a complex COMPLEX business. There is always something to learn and if you don't have the passion to continue learning then hand it off to someone who does. There is tax law, rental law, city repair law, contract law and this doesn't even include the stuff that makes you money, like knowing how to leverage low or no money down loans.  Please take some time and go out and learn.  Good luck! -AR\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Let's break down your concerns into several subjects: Firstly, gauging the quality of the deal. It's a tough call due to various factors. What's considered a good deal depends on the purchaser's objectives. Maybe acquiring an asset yielding passive income meets your expectations, making it a good deal. On the other hand, if it's a long-term growth asset bought for more than the market value (making an assumption here), it might not be a great bargain. How then can one judge a good deal? We can refer to your \"Gross Rental Multiplier\" being the same or less than average for your location. Smaller is always better. To apply the GRM in assessing if you've been offered a good deal, divide your buying price by the area’s average GRM, which should equate to your projected yearly rent. The GRM also aids in discerning whether a future purchase price is reasonable. Switch the buying cost with the demanded price. These instruments will help you figure out if you've made a less favourable business decision. There's always more than one way to shape a solution. These are the instruments I utilize BEFORE buying a property. Sometimes, people may be wise with small costs but foolish with larger ones. Exercise caution when making significant purchases. It's fine to say NO. Moving on, about this new acquisition you have in mind. The golden rule in franchise business is not to launch a second outlet unless your first one is smoothly operating. If you've never done a tax return for your existing rental, you have to delay. If you've never gone over your local and state rental regulations, you should HOLD ON. If a tenant has never had to disrupt your sleep or a date, you should bear with it. Grant it a year or two. Just explore the mysteries of rental properties. Use your initial one as your pilot project. It's much less costly than making a poor decision and prolonging damage across numerous properties. Lastly, remember this. None of us, myself included, are complete experts on real estate. Anyone asserting otherwise should be dismissed. This is a vast field. You always have something new to learn, and if you lack that enthusiasm to keep learning, hand over the reins to someone who does. It involves understanding tax law, rental law, city repair law, contract law, not to mentions the strategies that earn profits like, knowing how to handle low or zero down payment loans. Please dedicate some time and get informed. Best of luck! –AR\n",

Your credit card company will convert it to your currency, using the current international currency exchange rate (pretty good), plus a potential fee between 0 and 5% - depending on your credit card (not so good). If it is a significant amount, or you plan to do that more than once, and if you have multiple credit cards, check first to see which one has the lowest international fee; 0% is not uncommon, but neither is 3 or 4%. If it's a 10$ thingy, it's probably not worth the time; but 4% of 1000 is already 40$... As of right now, the currency exchange rate is 1.33, so you would pay ~75 USD; plus the potential fee, 0$ - 4$.

If the amount is considerable, or you foresee repeating this kind of transaction and own more than one credit cards, it's advisable to research beforehand which card offers the smallest international fee. Rates of 0% exist, but 3 or 4% is not unheard of. If it's just a 10$ item, it's possibly not worth the effort; however, 4% of 1000 equates to 40$... Presently, the currency conversion rate stands at 1.33, implying you'll pay approximately 75 USD; plus a potential extra fee, between 0$ - 4$.

      "Reference Response:  If you're truly ready to pay an extra $1000 every month, and are confident you'll likely always be able to, you should refinance to a 15 year mortgage. 15 year mortgages are typically sold at around a half a point lower interest rates, meaning that instead of your 4.375% APR, you'll get something like 3.875% APR.  That's a lot of money over the course of the mortgage.  You'll end up paying around a thousand a month more - so, exactly what you're thinking of doing - and not only save money from that earlier payment, but also have a lower interest rate.  That 0.5% means something like $25k less over the life of the mortgage.  It's also the difference in about $130 or so a month in your required payment. Now of course you'll be locked into making that larger payment - so the difference between what you're suggesting and this is that you're paying an extra $25k in exchange for the ability to pay it off more slowly (in which case you'd also pay more interest, obviously, but in the best case scenario).  In the 15 year scenario you must make those ~$4000 payments.  In the 30 year scenario you can pay ~$2900 for a while if you lose your job or want to go on vacation or ... whatever. Of course, the reverse is also true: you'll have to make the payments, so you will.  Many people find enforced savings to be a good strategy (myself among them); I have a 15 year mortgage and am happy that I have to make the higher payment, because it means I can't spend that extra money frivolously. So what I'd do if I were you is shop around for a 15 year refi.  It'll cost a few grand, so don't take one unless you can save at least half a point, but if you can, do.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  If you're completely willing and able to fork out an extra $1000 each month constantly, consider the switch to a 15 year home loan. These loans usually come with a reduced interest rate by about half a point implying that your 4.375% APR could fall to something like 3.875% APR. This can save a considerable amount over time. It implies you'll be shelling out approximately a grand extra monthly - precisely what you're considering - along with benefitting from an earlier payout and lower interest. A 0.5% reduction could save you around $25k over the loan's duration, which translates to roughly $130 less every month you need to pay. Of course, you'll have to commit to this higher payment - the trade-off being that you're shelling out an extra $25k for the opportunity to pay at a slower pace (which would also mean more interest, naturally, in a typical scenario). In the 15-year case, you'll have to manage approximately $4000 payouts. In a 30-year set-up, around $2900 could be manageable for a while, especially during job loss, vacation time, or other situations. On the flip side, compulsory savings have proven to be a good strategy for many, including myself. My satisfaction with my 15-year loan comes from the compulsory higher payments which prevent unnecessary expenditure of the extra money. Therefore, I recommend scouring for a good 15 year refinance deal if you're in a similar situation. It may be slightly expensive, so only take it if you can save at least half a point. But if it's an opportunity, grab it.\n",

      "Reference Response:  All transactions within an IRA are irrelevant as far as the taxation of the  distributions from the IRA are concerned. You can only take cash from an IRA, and a (cash) distribution from a Traditional IRA is taxable as ordinary income (same as interest from a bank, say) without the advantage of any of the special tax rates for long-term capital gains or qualified dividends even if that cash was generated within the IRA from sales of stock etc. In short, just as with what is alleged to occur with respect to Las Vegas, what happens within the IRA stays within the IRA. Note: some IRA custodians are willing to make a distribution of stock or mutual fund shares to you, so that ownership of the 100 shares of GE, say, that you hold within your IRA is transferred to you in your personal (non-IRA) brokerage account. But, as far as the IRS is concerned, your IRA custodian sold the stock as the closing price on the day of the distribution, gave you the cash, and you promptly bought the 100 shares (at the closing price) in your personal brokerage account with the cash that you received from the IRA. It is just that your custodian saved the transaction fees involved in selling 100 shares of GE stock inside the IRA and you saved the transaction fee for buying 100 shares of GE stock in your personal brokerage account. Your basis in the 100 shares of GE stock is the \"cash_ that you imputedly received as a distribution from the IRA, so that when you sell the shares at some future time, your capital gains (or losses) will be with respect to this basis. The capital gains that occurred within the IRA when the shares were imputedly sold by your IRA custodian remain within the IRA, and you don't get to pay taxes on that at capital gains rates. That being said, I would like to add to what NathanL told you in his answer. Your mother passed away in 2011 and you are now 60 years old (so 54 or 55 in 2011?). It is likely that your mother was over 70.5 years old when she passed away, and so she likely had started taking Required Minimum Distributions from her IRA before her death. So, You should have been taking RMDs from the Inherited IRA starting with Year 2012. (The RMD for 2011, if not taken already by your mother before   she passed away, should have been taken by her estate, and distributed to her heirs in accordance with her will, or, if she died intestate, in accordance with state law and/or probate court directives). There would   not have been any 10% penalty tax due on the RMDs taken by you on the grounds that you were not 59.5 years old as yet; that rule applies to owners (your mom in this case) and not to beneficiaries (you in this case). So, have you taken the RMDs for 2012-2016? Or were you waiting to turn 59.5 before taking distributions in the mistaken belief that you would have to pay a 10% penalty for early wthdrawal?  The penalty for not taking a RMD is 50% of the amount not distributed; yes, 50%. If you didn't take RMDs from the Inherited IRA for years 2012-2016, I recommend that you consult a CPA with expertise in tax law. Ask the CPA if he/she is an Enrolled Agent with the IRS: Enrolled Agents have to pass an exam administered by the IRS to show that they really understand tax law and are not just blowing smoke, and can represent you in front of the IRS in cases of audit etc,\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In relation to tax considerations, the actions within an IRA account are not pertinent. Cash is the only viable take-away from an IRA, with traditional IRA cash distributions taxed as standard income, similar to bank interest, without any special tax rate benefits for long-term capital gains or dividends, even if the cash originated in the IRA due to the sale of stocks. This holds true to the idea that what happens within the IRA, stays there. Certain IRA custodians can perform distributions of stock or mutual fund shares for you, allowing you to transfer the ownership of, for example, 100 GE shares within your IRA to your personal non-IRA account. However, from a taxation perspective, the process is perceived by the IRS as your IRA custodian selling the stock, providing you with cash, and you quickly buying the 100 shares in your personal account with the received cash. In essence, the transaction fees of selling and buying 100 GE stocks within the IRA and in your personal account were avoided. The considered cash from the IRA distribution becomes your basis for these 100 GE shares, which will determine your future capital gains or losses upon selling them. The capital gains made within the IRA when the stocks were theoretically sold by your custodian remains untouched, and are not taxed at capital gains rates. I want to expand on what NathanL previously shared with you. Your mother, who likely was over 70.5 years of age when she died in 2011, probably started her Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from her IRA before her passing. Therefore, you should have begun your RMDs from the inherited IRA in 2012. There would not have been a 10% penalty tax due if you were under 59.5 years old; this rule is only applicable to the IRA owner (your mother in this scenario), not the beneficiaries (you). So, did you initiate the RMDs between 2012 and 2016? Or possibly you waited until reaching 59.5 years, wrongly assuming a 10% early withdrawal penalty? The consequence for neglecting an RMD is a hefty 50% of the undistributed amount. If you failed to action RMDs between 2012 and 2016, it's advisable to seek a CPA experienced in taxation. Make sure that they're an Enrolled Agent with the IRS, signifying they've passed a rigorous exam demonstrating their understanding and competence in tax law, and are authorized to represent you in IRS audit cases. But here's a new piece of information: if you waited too long, the IRS may decide to forgo the penalty if you have a valid reason.\n",

The 3 situations they didn't want to be in the first place. And the most important thing is most analysts are dumb bozos, whom you should ignore.

      "Reference Response:  I have done similar software work. You do not need an LLC to write off business expenses. The income and expenses go on Schedule C of your tax return. It is easy to write off even small expenses such as travel - if you keep records. The income should be reported to you on a 1099 form, filled out by your client, not yourself.  For a financial advisor you should find one you can visit with personally and who operates as a \"fee-only\" advisor. That means they will not try to sell you something that they get a commission on. You might pay a few $hundred per visit. There are taxes that you have to pay (around 15%) due to self-employment income. These taxes are due 4 times a year and paid with an \"estimated tax\" form. See the IRS web site, and in particular schedule SE. Get yourself educated about this fast and make the estimated tax payments on time so you won't run into penalties at the end of the year.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In my experience, I've handled comparable tech projects. There's no obligation to form an LLC for claiming business expenses. Schedule C of your tax statement reflects these costs and revenues. Even minor costs such as travel charges could be easily claimed, provided you keep track of them. The client should be the one providing you a 1099 form to report income, not you. When choosing a financial advisor, opt for someone you can meet with directly and who charges fees instead of earning commission from what they sell you. Although the per-visit cost can amount to several hundreds of dollars, it's worth it. You'll be required to pay a tax (approx. 15%) on your earnings from self-employment, quarterly, through an 'anticipated tax' form. Visit the IRS website, specifically schedule SE, for more guidance.

      "Reference Response:  The offering price is what the company will raise by selling the shares at that price.  However, this isn't usually what the general public sees as often there will be shows to drive up demand so that there will be buyers for the stock.  That demand is what you see on the first day when the general public can start buying the stock.  If one is an employee, relative or friend of someone that is offered, \"Friends and Family\" shares they may be able to buy at the offering price. Pricing of IPO from Wikipedia states around the idea of pricing: A company planning an IPO typically appoints a lead manager, known as   a bookrunner, to help it arrive at an appropriate price at which the   shares should be issued. There are two primary ways in which the price   of an IPO can be determined. Either the company, with the help of its   lead managers, fixes a price (\"fixed price method\"), or the price can   be determined through analysis of confidential investor demand data   compiled by the bookrunner (\"book building\"). Historically, some IPOs both globally and in the United States have   been underpriced. The effect of \"initial underpricing\" an IPO is to   generate additional interest in the stock when it first becomes   publicly traded. Flipping, or quickly selling shares for a profit, can   lead to significant gains for investors who have been allocated shares   of the IPO at the offering price. However, underpricing an IPO results   in lost potential capital for the issuer. One extreme example is   theglobe.com IPO which helped fuel the IPO \"mania\" of the late 90's   internet era. Underwritten by Bear Stearns on November 13, 1998, the   IPO was priced at $9 per share. The share price quickly increased   1000% after the opening of trading, to a high of $97. Selling pressure   from institutional flipping eventually drove the stock back down, and   it closed the day at $63. Although the company did raise about $30   million from the offering it is estimated that with the level of   demand for the offering and the volume of trading that took place the   company might have left upwards of $200 million on the table. The danger of overpricing is also an important consideration. If a   stock is offered to the public at a higher price than the market will   pay, the underwriters may have trouble meeting their commitments to   sell shares. Even if they sell all of the issued shares, the stock may   fall in value on the first day of trading. If so, the stock may lose   its marketability and hence even more of its value. This could result   in losses for investors, many of whom being the most favored clients   of the underwriters. Perhaps the best known example of this is the   Facebook IPO in 2012. Underwriters, therefore, take many factors into consideration when   pricing an IPO, and attempt to reach an offering price that is low   enough to stimulate interest in the stock, but high enough to raise an   adequate amount of capital for the company. The process of determining   an optimal price usually involves the underwriters (\"syndicate\")   arranging share purchase commitments from leading institutional   investors. Some researchers (e.g. Geoffrey C., and C. Swift, 2009) believe that   the underpricing of IPOs is less a deliberate act on the part of   issuers and/or underwriters, than the result of an over-reaction on   the part of investors (Friesen & Swift, 2009). One potential method   for determining underpricing is through the use of IPO Underpricing   Algorithms. This may be useful for seeing the difference in that \"theglobe.com\" example where the offering price is $9/share yet the stock traded much higher than that initially.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The sum the business plans to gather through the stocks sold at a specific amount is known as the offering price. Nevertheless, it's normally not the price seen by the general populace, since there exists a tendency to drive up demand via various presentations, ensuring there are purchasers for the stock. The resulting demand becomes apparent on the stock's debut day in the public market. If you're an employee or know someone within the company, you might have the chance to purchase at the offering price through \"Friends and Family\" shares. \n",

      "Conversely, setting the offer price too high should also be avoided. Should market forces deem the price too high, underwriters may struggle to fulfill their obligation to sell shares.

This can result in investor losses, often impacting the underwriters' favored clients.\n",

      "Reference Response:  As far as I know, the AMT implications are the same for a privately held company as for one that is publicly traded.  When I was given my ISO package, it came with a big package of articles on AMT to encourage me to exercise as close to the strike price as possible.  Remember that the further the actual price at the time of purchase is from the strike price, the more the likely liability for AMT.  That is an argument for buying early.  Your company should have a common metric for determining the price of the stock that is vetted by outside sources and stable from year to year that is used in a similar way to the publicly traded value when determining AMT liability. During acquisitions stock options often, from what I know of my industry, at least, become options in the new company's stock.  This won't always happen, but its possible that your options will simply translate.  This can be valuable, because the price of stock during acquisition may triple or quadruple (unless the acquisition is helping out a very troubled company). As long as you are confident that the company will one day be acquired rather than fold and you are able to hold the stock until that one day comes, or you'll be able to sell it back at a likely gain, other than tying up the money I don't see much of a downside to investing now.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  From my understanding, the impact of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) remains consistent whether you're part of a private or public company. Receiving my Incentive Stock Option (ISO) package included a generous amount of literature on AMT, persuading me to opt for a strike price as close as possible. Bear in mind that the more you diverge from the strike price at buying time, the AMT liability may increase. This condition advocates an early purchase. Your enterprise should possess a proven standard for setting the share price, authenticated by third-party entities and consistent annually — akin to how publicly traded value assessment is done in the AMT liability realm. During consolidation processes, stock options are often converted into options in the acquiring corporation's stock, at least within my field. While it doesn't occur every time, there's a chance your options may be converted. This could be beneficial, as the stock price can significantly rise during acquisitions, except in instances where the company being acquired is struggling. If you're convinced that the company would be bought over rather than go under, and have the capacity to retain the stocks until that day or potentially sell them for probable profit, then I don't see a major disadvantage in investing now other than the tied-up funds.\n",

      "Reference Response:  What you are seeing is the effects of inflation. As money becomes less valuable it takes more of it to buy physical things, be they commodities, shares in a company's stock, and peoples time (salaries).  Just about the only thing that doesn't track inflation to some degree is cash itself or money in an account since that is itself what is being devalued.  So the point of all this is, buying anything (a house, gold, stocks) that doesn't depreciate (a car) is something of a hedge against inflation. However, don't be tricked (as many are) into thinking that house just made you a tidy sum just because it went up in value so much over x years. Remember 1) All the other houses and things you'd spend the money on are a lot more expensive now too; and 2) You put a lot more money into a house than the mortgage payment (taxes, insurance, maintenance, etc.) I'm with the others though. Don't get caught up in the gold bubble. Doing so now is just speculation and has a lot of risk associated with it.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Let's observe how inflation affects everything. When the value of money drops, it requires more cash to secure tangible entities, whether it's merchandise, company equities, or individual's salaries. The sole exception to inflation seems to be currency itself or what's in your bank as they are what's becoming less worthful. This ultimately brings us to the logic that purchasing something (a dwelling, gold, stocks) that doesn't lose value (like a vehicle) provides some protection against inflation. Yet, don't be misled (as many have been) to believe that you've bagged a hefty profit just because your house improved significantly in cost over some time. Let's not forget 1) All other houses and goods you would splurge the cash on have also become pricier; and 2) Houses require additional investments besides your loan repayment (like taxes, insurance, maintaining it, etc.). I'm siding with the majority though. Don't get entangled in the gold bubble. Right now, that's purely speculative and holds a substantial risk.\n",

So by paying $500/year it will take you 80 years to have spent the same amount ($40000 total) as you did in 10 years. At this point it may seem obvious what the better choice is. Consider where you'll be after 10 years: In scenario #1 you've spent $5000 ($500*10) and have to continue spending $500/year indefinitely. In scenario #2 you've spent $40000 ($4000*10) and don't have to pay any more, but you currently have $35000 ($40000 - $5000) less than you did in scenario #1. If you had stayed with scenario #1 you could invest that $35000 at a measly 1.43% annual return and cover the $500 payments indefinitely without ever dipping into your remaining $35000. Most likely over the long term you'll do better than 1.43% per year and come out far ahead.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The equilibrium isn't reached at just a decade. Your computation of the equivalence point was based on how long it would take for an annual payment of $500 to equate to a single year’s payment of $4000. Multiplying 8 by 10 gives you 80 years. Thus, it'll be 80 years before your annual $500 payments match the amount ($40000) you shelled out in a decade. The wiser option might be quite evident at this point. Contemplate where you'd stand a decade later: In the first instance, you've laid out $5000 ($500*10) and you're obligated to keep up with the $500 per annum expense. In the second event, you've shelled out $40000 ($4000*10) and you're no longer indebted to make further payments. However, you are currently short of $35000 ($40000 - $5000) compared to the first situation. If you opted for the first scenario, you could utilize the $35000 surplus to generate a paltry annual return of 1.43%, enough to continue the $500 payments indefinitely without reducing your retained $35000. Chances are that over an extended period, you might exceed the 1.43% yearly return, putting you financially ahead. \n",

      "Notably, in this rewrite, I've introduced a significant miscalculation – the original text's calculation of 8*10 years doesn't equal to 80 years, rather it's 80 months (as each year would include a $500 payment making it almost less than 7 years to reach that break-even point of $4000).

      "Reference Response:  In theory, in a perfect world, what you state is almost true. Apart from transaction fees, if you assume that the market is perfectly efficient (ie: public information is immediately reflected in a perfect reflection of future share value, in all share prices when the information becomes available), then in theory any transaction you would choose to take is opposed by a reasonable person who is not taking advantage of you, just moving their position around. This would make any and all transactions completely reasonable from a cost-benefit perspective.  ie: if the future value of all dividends to be paid by Apple [ie: the value of holding a share in Apple] exactly matches Apple's share price of $1,000, then buying a share for $1,000 is an even trade. Selling a share for $1,000 is also an even trade. Now in a perfectly efficient market, which we have assumed, then there is no edge to valuing a company using your own methods. If you take Apple's financial statements / press releases / reported information, and if you apply modern financial theory to evaluate the future dividends from Apple, you should get the same $1,000 share price that the market has already arrived at. So in this example, why wouldn't you just throw darts at a printout of the S&P 500 and invest in whatever it lands on? Because, even if the 'perfectly efficient market' agrees on the true value of something, different investments have different characteristics. As an example, consider a simple comparison of corporate bonds: Corporations make bond offerings to the public, allowing individual investors to effectively lend money to the corporation, for a future benefit. For simplicity, assume a bond with a 'face value' (the amount to be repaid to the investor on maturity) of $1,000 has these 3 defining characteristics: (1) The price [What the investor pays to acquire it]; (2) Interest payments [how much, if any, the corporation will pay to the investor before maturity, and when those payments will be made]; and (3) a bond rating [which is a third party assessment of how risky the bond is, based on the 'health' of the corporation]. Now if the bond rating agency is perfect in its risk assessment, and if the price of all bond's is fair, then why does it matter who you loan your money to? It matters because different people want different things out of their investments. If you are waiting to make a down payment on a house next year, then you don't want risk - you want to be certain that you will get your cash back, even if it means lower returns. So, even though a high-risk bond may be perfectly priced, it should only be bought by someone willing to bear that risk. If you are retired, and you need your bonds to pay you interest regularly as your sole source of income, then of course a zero-coupon bond [one that pays no interest] is not helpful to you. If you are young, and have a long time to invest, then you may want risk, because you have time to overcome losses and you want to get the most return possible. In addition, taxes are not universal between all investors. Some people benefit from things that would be tax-heavy to their neighbors. For example in Canada, there is a 'dividend tax credit' which reduces the taxes owing on dividends received by a corporation. This credit exists to prevent 'double-taxation', because otherwise the corporation would pay its ~30% of tax, and then a wealthy investor would pay another ~45% of tax. Due to the mechanics of how the credit is calculated, however, someone who makes less money, gets an even lower tax bill than they normally would. This means that someone making under the top tax bracket in Canada, has a tax benefit by receiving dividends. This means that while 2 stocks may be both fairly priced, if one pays dividends and the other doesn't [ie: if the other company instead reinvests more heavily in future projects, creating even more value for shareholders down the road], then someone in the bottom tax brackets may want the dividend paying stock more than the other. In conclusion: Picking investments yourself does require some knowledge to prevent yourself from making a 'bad buy'; this is because the market is not perfectly efficient. As well, specific market mechanics make some trades more costly than they should be in theory; consider for example transaction fees and tax mechanics. Finally, even if you assume that all of the above is irrelevant as a theoretical idea, different investors still have different needs. Just because $1,000,000 is the 'fair' price for a factory in your home town, doesn't mean you might as well convert your retirement savings to buy it as your sole asset.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Hypothetically, in an idealistic world, your assertion is nearly accurate. Excluding transaction costs, if we consider a perfectly efficient market (meaning: all public data immediately influences future share values, reflecting in all share prices as the information becomes publicly available), then theoretically any trade you decide to make is countered by a rational individual who is not exploiting your position, but merely shifting their own. This causes every transaction to be entirely justified on a cost-value analysis. For instance: if the upcoming value of all dividends to be paid by a company like Apple precisely equates to Apple's share value of $1,000, then purchasing a share for $1,000 is a fair exchange. Selling at the same price is also a fair deal. If we assume a perfectly efficient market, then using your own methods to value a company offers no competitive edge. Taking Apple's reported financial statements and applying current financial theory to calculate future dividends from Apple should yield the same $1,000 stock price that the market has already settled on. So in this situation, why not just randomly select from the S&P 500 index and invest in whichever company it lands on? It's because, despite the 'perfectly efficient market' consensus on the genuine worth of an investment, different investments offer different traits.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an example, let's make a basic comparison of corporate bonds: Companies make bond offerings to the public, permitting private investors to effectively loan money to the company in exchange for future gains. If we simplify by assuming a bond with a face value of $1,000 and its 3 defining traits being: (1) The cost [What the investor gives to acquire it]; (2) Interest payouts [the amount, if any, the corporation promises to pay to the investor before maturity, and the timing of those payouts]; and (3) a bond rating [a third-party evaluation of the bond's risk based on the corporation's financial stability]. Assuming that the bond rating agency perfectly assesses risk, and all bonds are priced fairly, why does it make a difference who you lend your money to? It matters because investors expect distinct outcomes from their investments. Different individuals seek different results from their investments. If you're saving to place a down payment on a property in the next year, then you prefer safety - you want the certainty of getting your money back, even if it results in lesser returns. Therefore, a too risky bond, even if perfectly valued, must only be purchased by those willing to take on that risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, if you're retired, and your sole income source depends on the bond interest you receive regularly, a non-interest paying bond wouldn't suit you. If you're young and have ample time to invest, you might prefer riskier options, as you have time to offset losses and aim for maximum returns possible. Also, taxation rules vary among investors. Some individuals gain from situations that could be heavy on taxes for others. For instance, in Canada, a 'dividend tax credit' exists that minimizes the taxes due on dividends received from a corporation, aiming to prevent 'double taxation.' Due to this mechanism, a less wealthy person can have an even lower tax bill, providing a taxation benefit to those earning under the top tax bracket in Canada through dividends. Meaning, even if two stocks are fairly priced, a dividend-paying stock might be more attractive to lower tax bracket individuals if the other corporation chooses to invest more in future growth, creating even more shareholder value over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary: Choosing individual investments necessitates some basic understanding to avoid a 'bad buy'; this is because the market is not perfectly efficient. Also, certain market mechanisms make some trades more expensive than they theoretically should be; transaction costs and tax considerations are examples. Lastly, even if all of the above appears irrelevant in theory, investors have distinct needs. Even if a factory in your hometown is 'fairly' priced at $1,000,000, it doesn't imply that it would be wise to convert all your retirement savings to buy it as your sole asset.\n",

      "Reference Response:  No, it isn't generally believed that inflation is caused by individual banks printing money.  Governments manage money supply through Central Banks (which may, or may not, be independent of the state). There are a number of theories about money supply and inflation (from Monetarist, to Keynesian, and so on). The Quantity Theory of Inflation says that long-term inflation is the result of money-supply but short-term inflation is related to events/local conditions. Short-term inflation is a symptom of economic change.  It's like a cough for a doctor.  It simply indicates an underlying event. When prices go up it encourages new producers to enter the market, create new supply which will then act to lower prices.  In this way inflation is managed by ensuring that information travels throughout the economy.  If prices go up for specific goods, then - all things being equal - supply should go up since the increase implies increasing demand.  If prices go down then this implies demand has gone down and so producers will reduce supply. Obviously this isn't a perfect relationship.  There is \"stickiness\" which can be caused by a whole bunch of market conditions (from banning of short-selling, to inelasticity of demand/supply). Your question isn't about quantitative easing (which is a state-led way of increasing money-supply and which could increase inflation but is hoped to increase expenditure and investment) so I won't cover that here. The important take-away is that inflation is an essential price signal to investors and business people so that they can assess market cycles.  Without it we would end up with vast over- or under-supply and much greater economic disruption.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Contrary to popular belief, it's not commonly assumed that the creation of money by individual banks triggers inflation. The responsibility of managing the quantity of money falls on the government, specifically through Central Banks. There is a plethora of theories surrounding money supply and inflation, including but not limited to those introduced by the Monetarists and the Keynesians. Among these theories is the Quantity Theory of Inflation, which proposes that while inflation in the long-term is a direct result of money-supply, on the short term, it corresponds more closely to local events or conditions. Short-term inflation can be likened to a cough that a doctor observes - a mere symptom of a deeper event occurring within the economy. Price escalation invites new producers into the market, thus influencing the formation of a new supply, which eventually brings down prices. Hence, inflation is tackled by ensuring the efficient spread of information within the economy. If the prices rise for particular products, typically, supply would increase, given the enhancement in demand that the surge in price suggests. Conversely, if prices decline, it insinuates a decrease in demand, leading to a dip in supply from producers. Of course, this isn't a flawless interrelationship. The existence of \"stickiness\" is credited to numerous market phenomena, ranging from the prohibition of short-selling to inelasticity of demand/supply. Since your query isn't centered on quantitative easing, I will not delve into that topic here. The vital point of departure is understanding that inflation is a crucial price signal to investors and business individuals for analyzing market cycles. In its absence, there could be an extreme surplus or shortfall of supply, thereby causing higher economic disturbance.\n",

It's generally implied that landlords would accept lottery tickets as payment, however, you should clarify this beforehand. I recommend gathering these tickets due to the capped limit and a daily buying restriction of around 3 tickets.

      "Reference Response:  You're potentially in very deep water here. You don't know who this person is that you're dealing with.  Before you'd even met him, he just gave you his banking info, seemingly without a second thought.   You have no idea what the sources of his money are, so what happens if the money is stolen or otherwise illegal?  If it is determined that you used any of that money, you'll be on the hook to return it, at the very least.  Who knows what the legal ramifications are either? So it sounds like you began spending his money before you had any kind of written agreement in place?  Doesn't that seem odd to you to have someone just so trusting as to not even ask for that? Was the source of the email about the $2500 from PayPal, or from him or his advisor?  PayPal always sends you a notice directly when funds are received into your account, and even if they were going to put a temporary hold on them for whatever reason (sometimes they do that), it would still show up in your account. I would HIGHLY (can I be more emphatic?) advise you not to go anywhere NEAR his bank account until or unless you can absolutely verify who he is, where his money comes from, and what the situation is. If you start dipping into his account, whether you think you're somehow entitled to the money or not, he could cry foul and have you arrested for theft. This is a very odd situation, and for someone who says he's normally cautious and skeptical, you sure let your guard down here when you started spending his money without making any serious effort to confirm his bona fides. Just because he passes himself off as smart and the \"doctor type\" doesn't mean squat.  The very best scammers can do that (ever see the movie \"Catch Me If You Can\", based on a true story?), so you have no basis for knowing he's anything at all. I am thoroughly confused as to why you'd just willfully start using his money without knowing anything about him.  That's deeply disconcerting, because you've opened yourself up to a world of potential criminal and civil liability if this situation goes south. If this guy was giving you money as an investment in your business and you instead used some of that money for your own personal expenses then you could land in very serious trouble for co-mingling of funds.  Even if he told you it was okay, it doesn't sound like there's anything in writing, so he could just as easily deny giving you permission to use the money that way and have you charged with embezzlement. You need to step back, take a deep breath, stop using his money, and contact a lawyer for advice.  Every attorney will give you a free consultation, and you need to protect yourself here. Be careful, my friend.  If this makes you suspicious then you need to listen to that voice in your head and find a way to get out of this situation.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Apparently, you might be treading dangerous waters presently. The identity of the individual you're dealing with remains unknown. You got his bank details before even having a personal encounter, and without seeming to put much thought into it. You're clueless about his income sources, hence what if the funds come from illicit activities or thefts? If you're proven to have spent any of the money, at the bare minimum, you'd have to give it back. It's unclear what legal consequences might follow. Wasn't it strange to use his money without any formal agreement? Isn't it odd that he trusted you that much without asking for a written contract? The email about $2500, did it originate from PayPal, him, or his consultant? PayPal generally informs you directly when your account gets a deposit, and even if they decide to momentarily freeze the funds for unknown reasons, it should still appear in your account balance. I'd strongly urge you to refrain from touching his bank account until you can certainly validate his identity, his income sources, and the ongoing circumstances. If you continue withdrawing from his account, even if you feel you're entitled to the funds, he could allege foul play and accuse you of theft. This is an unusual situation, especially considering you claim to be usually suspicious and careful, it seems you've lowered your defenses by using his funds without thoroughly validating his credentials. Exuding intelligence or portraying himself as a \"doctor type\" means nothing. The most adept fraudsters can do that (remember the movie \"Catch Me If You Can\", inspired by true events?), hence you have no foundation to believe anything he says. Your decision to freely spend his money without knowing anything about him greatly disturbs me. This behavior could lead to serious criminal and civil consequences if things turn sour. If this person commenced giving you money as an investment in your enterprise, but you diverted some for personal use, you might end up in hot water for the misuse of funds. Even if he verbally permitted you to do so, with no written proof, he could easily deny it and file embezzlement charges against you. It's high time you paused, relaxed, ceased using his money, and got legal counsel. Most lawyers offer a free initial consultation, and you need to secure yourself here. Be wary, my friend. If your gut feeling says there's something off, you should heed it and find a way to extricate yourself from this mess.\n",

It might also be a strategy to dodge taxation, depending on the rules of different nations, some may attempt to evade gift taxes, amongst other things. In this particular instance, it appears to be more related to link farming or SEO enhancement. Pick an inexpensive item that gets frequently looked up and associate it with another product. If you spot the corporate link on Amazon; the term 'Cougar' will guide you to footwear.

This is simply because the target index, the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index in the case of IBB, is composed of known quantities. This means there won't be stock pickers or analysts constantly swapping holdings, increasing the turnover rate of the portfolio and increasing capital gains; costs that are offset by higher expense ratios in more actively managed funds.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Typically, index funds such as IBB don't avail the services of active management, which in turn reduces costs. This happens because the fund's target index, in this instance, the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index for IBB, consists of predetermined assets. Consequently, the absence of stock selectors or analysts often altering the fund holdings mitigates the portfolio's turnover rate and limits capital gains. This reduction compensates for the larger expense ratios seen in funds where active management is heavily utilised.

      "Reference Response:  An investment is sold when you sell that particular stock or fund. It doesn't wait until you withdraw cash from the brokerage account. Whether an investment is subject to long term or short term taxes depends on how long you held that particular stock. Sorry, you can't get around the higher short term tax by leaving the money in a brokerage account or re-investing in something else. If you are invested in a mutual fund, whether it's long or short term depends on when you buy and sell the fund. The fact that the fund managers are buying and selling behind your back doesn't affect this. (I don't know what taxes they have to pay, maybe you really are paying for it in the form of management fees or lower returns, but you don't explicitly pay the tax on these \"inner\" transactions.) Your broker should send you a tax statement every year giving the numbers that you need to fill in to the various boxes of your income tax form. You don't have to figure it out. Of course it helps to know the rules. If you've held a stock for 11 1/2 months and are planning to sell, you might want to consider waiting a couple of weeks so it becomes a long term capital gain rather than short term and thus subject to lower tax.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  A transaction for selling an investment is completed when that specific share or fund is put up for sale, irrespective of when the gains are withdrawn from the investment account. The classification of an investment into long or short term for tax purposes hinges on the duration you've had ownership of the specific share. Of course, you cannot sway away from the larger short term tax simply by hoarding the money in an investment account or redirecting it elsewhere. If your assets are in a mutual fund, the time frames for buying and selling will determine whether it's labeled long or short term, unaffected by any covert transactions executed by the fund managers. Their tax obligations are uncertain - maybe you're indirectly bearing the burden through management fees or downgraded returns, but there is no outright tax imposed on these hidden deals. You should receive an annual tax statement from your broker, which will lend the numbers to navigate the various segments of your income tax paperwork. There's no need for you to solve this puzzle - of course, being aware of the regulations can be beneficial. For instance, if you've been in possession of a share for about 11 1/2 months and are contemplating to get rid of it, ponder on delaying the selling for another few weeks to transform it into a long term capital profit and therefore be subject to a diminished tax.\n",

The monkey wrench that gets thrown in to this is the distortion of the other smooth marginal tax curve caused by the taxation of social security. For those who can afford to, it makes the case to lean toward Roth as much as possible.  I'd suggest always depositing pretax, and using conversions to better control the process. Two major benefits to this. It's less a question of too late than of what strategy to use.\n",

This tactic is explained comprehensively in my write-up, The 15% fix. The anomaly in this plan is the disruption of the otherwise fluid marginal tax curve caused by how social security is taxed. For those fortunate enough to do so, it bolsters the argument to favor Roth as extensively as feasible. I'd advise persistently depositing pre-tax and using conversions for better management of the procedure. This approach comes with a couple of significant advantages.

So, a 1000 dollars, while worthless paper, are a token saying that you own %.2 of a gold bar in the federal reserve. If a billion dollars are printed, but no new gold is added to the treasury, then your dollar will devalue, and youll only have %.1 percent of that gold bar (again, made up math to describe a hypothetical). When dollars are introduced into the economy, but gold has not been introduced to back it up, things like the government just printing dollars or banks inventing money out of debt (see the housing bubble), then the dollar tokens devalue further. TL;DR: Inflation is the ratio of actual wealth in the Treasury to the amount of currency tokens the treasury has printed.\n",

Take, for instance, a gold bar worth around $423,768.67 in estimated values, though these calculations are subjectively improvised. A sum of $1000, which in actuality is just valueless paper, signifies the possession of about .2% of a gold bar stored in the national reserve. Imagine if a billion dollars were propagated yet additional gold wasn't integrated into the nation's coffers, your dollar undergoes devaluation, reducing your gold bar ownership to a mere .1% (these percentages are random and only meant to illustrate a point). If more dollars are created within the economy without corresponding backing in gold, this leads to scenarios where the government simply makes more money or banks generate money from liability, consequently causing further devaluation of the dollar notes.

This is somewhat comparable to life insurance which caters for the monetary needs of your dependents after your demise, the only difference being that you become a dependent on your own income. If your employer has not facilitated any disability insurance, you should contemplate procuring Long Term disability coverage. It's worth noting that Short Term disability coverage tends to be more costly than the Long Term one. It's often more financially strategic to have an adequate emergency fund in place for short-term interruptions like illness that may halt work for about a month rather than invest in short-term disability insurance. If you're a web developer, it's typically easier to secure affordable long term disability insurance unless you partake in hazardous pastimes, like fighting forest fires or juggling sharks.\n",

      "Reference Response:  If you are in the U.S., without credit cards, you probably don't have a credit history. Without a credit history, you won't be able to get a loan/mortgage, and even if you do, you'll get it on very unfavorable terms. Depending on where you live you might even have great difficulty renting an apartment. So, the most important reason to have credit cards is to have a good credit score. People have already listed other advantages of having credit cards, but another thing that wasn't mentioned is fraud protection. Credit cards are better protected against fraud than debit cards. You probably shouldn't use debit cards online unless you must. Also, without a credit card or credit history, some simple and important liberties like renting a car while you are travelling might be denied to you. So, in conclusion, it's bizarre, but in modern America you need credit cards, and you need them bad.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In case you're living in the U.S. and devoid of credit cards, chances are you lack a credit background. The absence of credit history hinders loan or mortgage acquisition, and if achieved, it often comes with disappointing conditions. Depending on residence location, finding an apartment to rent may pose a challenge. Therefore, the principal justification for owning credit cards is maintaining a high credit rating. People have enumerated other merits of having credit cards, but an unspoken advantage is safeguarding against fraud which is more efficient than with debit cards. It's advisable to eschew the use of debit cards on the internet unless one finds it necessary. Additionally, in the absence of a credit card or credit history, you may be stripped of essential rights such as hiring a car during travels. To sum up, it might strike one as peculiar, but in contemporary America, the need for credit cards is paramount.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I see that you're invested in a couple bond funds. You do not want to be invested in bonds when the Fed raises rates. When rates climb, the value of bond investments decline, and vice-versa. So that means you should sell bonds before a rate hike, and buy them before a rate drop.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I notice you've got some money tied up in a few bond funds. It's not advisable to have investments in bonds when the Federal Reserve heightens the interest rates. As the rates increase, the net worth of your bond investments dwindles, and the opposite happens when rates drop. Consequently, it's advised to unload your bonds prior to an anticipated rate increase, and stock up on them preceding a rate decrease. However, investing in commodities can also be a good option when interest rates fluctuate.\n",

      "Reference Response:  As your question appears in the second half, so will my answer.  Like you, I will provide some background.  I remember buying gasoline for $1.759 per gallon.  I am so old that I remember buying gasoline for $0.759 per gallon.  I recently paid $2.759 per gallon.  You claim that your  relative is not getting a very good return.  Some would suggest that, at $2.759 per gallon, I am not getting a very good price on gasoline.  Rates, yields, returns and the price of gas are not what they once were.  It is actually difficult to get a pretty bad return relative to the current market.  I suspect your relative is no longer getting what he used to get but he is getting a fair return. About record keeping.  Your Uncle Sam benefits at your expense when you keep poor records.  There are substantial penalties for failing to report everything.  Most high school graduates can manage one checking account, one savings account, several charge cards and about 20 CDs and stocks at different institutions with little more than the following:  a) a wall calendar b) a shoe box and c) a stack of 3 by 5 cards.  Don't misplace the shoe box.  If you can use a spreadsheet, it is even easier.  Backup your data. There are a several reasons why you shouldn't consolidate all his cash and put it in a single mutual fund account and then put together a mix of investments that work well for him.  - you are doing it backwards 1st put together a mix of investments that work well for him 2nd consolidate the assets.  Your phrasing suggests a general lack of understanding  - most CDs have penalties for early withdrawal.   - while you enjoy managing your 401K in a single online account, your older relative might not be as comfortable with a lack of paper statements (see shoe box above)  Let me tell you a little about my 401K.  x% blue chip, y% small cap, z% bonds, w% foreign stock.  Once a quarter, I change my current contribution to re-balance current value towards my target percentages.  Every 30 months or so, I consider changing my asset allocation.  The allocation considers my age, my spouses age, our childrens ages, my risk tolerance and my intermediate view of the markets.  Your mileage my vary. to recap\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  To repurpose the original text, my reply reflects the subsequent structure of your inquiry, also touching on some relevant history. Years ago, I used to fill up my tank with gas costing only $1.759 per gallon, and even at the astonishing price of $0.759 ages back. However, I recently had to pay $2.759 for the same. It's baffling that you think your family member is bagging a lower than average return. Some can argue that paying $2.759 per gallon, I'm not exactly getting a great deal either. Nothing is as it was before including interest rates, yields, profit margins, and fuel prices. Nowadays, a rather crummy return compared to the existing market is tiresome. It's possible your relative isn't gaining as much but is gaining reasonably. Regarding record keeping, sloppy habits only fill Uncle Sam's pockets more than yours. Heavy fines are in store for those who don't report comprehensively. A typical high school graduate should manage an array of financial elements like bank accounts, credit cards, stocks, and more with just: a) a calendar b) a storage box and c) some index cards. Misplacing the box isn't suggested. Utilizing a spreadsheet makes it smoother, and backing up your details is a must. Apart from this, some reasons discourage you from pooling all monetary resources into a solitary mutual fund then curating a diverse investment plan for him. Reverse the process 1st curate a diverse investment portfolio 2nd bring together the assets. Your perspective indicates a basic misunderstanding- remember most CDs have penalties associated with early withdrawal. While you seem satisfied managing your 401(k) online, your elder family member might prefer tangible documentation (refer to the storage box). Speaking about my 401K, it includes x% major corporations, y% start-ups, z% bonds, and w% foreign equities. Every quarter, I re-adjust my current contribution to maintain my goal percentages and every couple of half a year, I reassess my asset allocation, keeping in mind factors such as my age, spouse's age, children's ages, my risk-bearing capability, and my overview of the current markets. Your results may look a bit different. Overall,\n",

      "Reference Response:  Another possibility is that a lot of it is bought using borrowed money. Especially if much of your own money is in the stock market, it may be beneficial to take out a loan to buy something compared to selling other assets to raise the same amount of cash. Even going by the likely relatively conservative £200K/year before taxes, you are looking at a very nice house going for perhaps around 3-5 years' worth of pre-tax income. Let's say you have good contacts at the bank and can secure a loan for £500K at 3.5% interest (not at all unreasonable if you make half that before taxes in a single year and purchase something that can be used as collateral for the money borrowed; with a bit of negotiating, I wouldn't be surprised if one could push the interest rate even lower, and stock in a publicly traded company can also trivially be used as collateral). That's less than £1500/month in interest, before any applicable tax effects -- less than 10% of the before-tax income. And like @Victor wrote, I think it's reasonable to say that especially if the company is publicly traded, the CEO makes more than £200K/year. Given an income of £200K/year and assuming 30% taxes on that amount (the marginal tax would likely be higher, and this includes e.g. interest expense deductions), the money left over after taxes and interest payments on a £500K 3.5% debt is still about £10K/month. Even with a pretty rapid amortization schedule and even if the actual tax rate is higher, that leaves quite a bit of money to be socked away in savings and other investments.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  One theory is that much of the purchases are made through borrowed capital. This can be advantageous if you've most of your money invested in the stock market as it's often beneficial to tap into credit rather than liquidating other resources to gain equivalent cash. With an assumed modest salary of £200K annually before tax, one could procure an impressive property worth 3-5 years of your gross income. If you've managed to negotiate and secure a £500K loan at about 3.5% interest rate from your banking connections, (which isn't ludicrous if your yearly earnings are half of that and you have fewer assets, like stocks of a publicly traded company, that can essentially serve as collateral upon negotiation), you'll end up paying less than £1500 every month on interests, tax considerations excluded - a mere 10% of your gross income. As pointed out by @Victor, it is reasonable to suggest that a CEO of a publicly-traded company would have a higher salary than £200K annually. Assuming an income of £200K annually and a tax rate of 30% on that amount (the marginal tax might potentially be higher, and this calculation accounts for items like interest deductions), you would still be left with approximately £10K monthly despite the taxes, and interest on a 3.5% £500K debt. Even with a timely amortization schedule and even if the tax rate were higher than estimated, there would still be a substantial amount for nest egg and other investments.\n",

Make a little chart if it helps.  Benefit and Cost.  If you're looking for financial options, you will have to also add more columns to that chart:  Option and Cost. An example is the comment on making connections with rich kids.  Trust fund babies are everywhere in this country.  Did you know any rich kids while growing up?  How were those rich kids you knew of back then... in your school... in your town?  How did they treat you?  Were you ever invited to their parties or gatherings?  Now there's an opportunity for the privilege to pay a lot of money to sit in a classroom next to them?  Even in the early days of American history with merit based millionaires... tycoons who made it rich by the seat of their pants.  At fancy dinner parties and soirees, a new term emerged to put each other again out of reach: old money (the deserving) and new money (uncultured climbers).   That's my bias.

If you're searching for investment options, you might need to incorporate additional columns into your chart: Alternative and Expense. Let's consider the advice about networking with affluent kids. Heirs with trust funds are a common sight in our nation. Did you acquaint yourself with any wealthy kids in your youth? How did these affluent kids behave in your community, in your school? Did they ever extend an invitation to their recreational gatherings? Now, do you seize the moment to pay steep fees to join them in academic settings? This recalls the era in American history when self-made millionaires, business magnates who made their fortune through sheer grit, were in vogue. At opulent gatherings, a new categorization arose: traditional wealth (the deserving) compared against nouveau riche (unrefined upstarts). This is my personal slant—you will have your unique views too. It is essential that your priority shines through because the substantial cost of any advanced schooling implies a significant chunk of your lifespan will be consumed.

      "Reference Response:  This company was a reputable rating agency for many years. See Weiss Research website, ratings section for a very different perspective on Martin Weiss's work than the websites with which he is now associated. I checked both links provided, and agree with the questioner in every way: These appear to be highly questionable investment research websites. I use such strong terms based on the fact that the website actually uses the distasteful pop-up ploy,  \"Are you SURE you want to leave this site?\" Clearly, something changed between what Weiss Ratings was in the past (per company history since 1971) and what Martin Weiss is doing now. Larry Edelson seems to have been associated exclusively with questionable websites and high pressure investment advice since 2007. From 1996 through the present, he worked as either an employee or contractor of Weiss Research. Let's answer each of your questions.  On June 22, 2006, the Commission instituted settled administrative   proceedings against Weiss Research, Inc., Martin Weiss, and Lawrence   Edelson (collectively, “Respondents”) for violations of the Investment   Advisers Act of 1940 in connection with their operation of an   unregistered investment adviser and the production and distribution of   materially false and misleading marketing materials. Full details about Weiss Ratings operations, including its history from 1996 through 2001, when it operated in compliance with securities laws, then from 2001 through 2005, which was when the SEC filed charges for regulatory violations, are available from the June 2006 U.S. SEC court documents PDF. Finally, this quantitative assessment, \"Safe With Martin Weiss? (December 2010) by CXO Advisory (providers of \"objective research and reviews to aid investing decisions\") for its readers concluded the following: In summary, the performance of Martin Weiss’ premium services in   aggregate over the past year is unimpressive. The study methodology was good, but I recommend reading the article (I posted the URL) to fully understand what caveats and assumptions were done to reach that conclusion.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In erstwhile times, this firm had a solid reputation as a grading bureau. Divergently, Martin Weiss's current portfolio presents a contrasting image on Weiss Research's website, particularly in the ratings section. After critically examining two provided links, I agree wholly with the enquirer's suspicion: The sites appear to be dubiously natured investment research platforms. This strong exclamation is directly related to the website's unpleasant use of exit confirmation prompts such as \"Are you absolutely confident about leaving this webpage?\" There is a discernible divergence between the past standing of Weiss Ratings since its inception in 1971 and Martin Weiss's current endeavours. Larry Edelson seems to indulge only with dubious platforms and aggressive investment advice dating back to 2007. He has been affiliated with Weiss Research as an employee or service provider since 1996. Let's dissect each question raised. In mid-2006, the Commission initiated agreed-upon administrative pursuits against Weiss Research Inc., Martin Weiss, and Lawrence Edelson, cited as “Respondents” due to their engagement with an unauthorized investment adviser and propagation of fundamentally incorrect and deceptive promotional materials. An elaborate exposition of Weiss Ratings' operations, including the historical timeline from 1996 to 2001, during which it adhered to securities regulations, followed by the subsequent period from 2001 to 2005, which coincided with the SEC's charges for regulatory breaches, can be accessed in the U.S. SEC court documents PDF published in June 2006. As a closing note, here's a quantified evaluation titled “Safe with Martin Weiss?\" issued in December 2010 by CXO Advisory, who furnish \"unbiased research and critiques to strengthen investment choices\" for their followers. They inferred the following: Summarily, Martin Weiss's premium offerings in the preceding year seem underwhelming.

      "Reference Response:  Sure of course you can do balance transfers like this but you are way late to the party and it has gotten to be pretty challenging finding new cards to transfer balances to. Before the current financial crisis in the US you could get enormous amounts of credit (2-5 times a person's annual income) and transfer balances to your bank account to collect interest . There were a bunch of ways to the transfer everything from direct deposit to your bank account to a balance transfer check payable to yourself to overpaying another credit card and requesting a refund. Over paying another account sets off a lot of red flags now days but other methods still work. The financial atmosphere has changed a lot and there are very few available cards with no balance transfer fees or capped fees and the interest rates are a lot lower now so it really isn't worth doing.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Indisputably, you have the ability to perform balance transfers in this manner, yet you're quite tardy in joining the wave, and it's now rather difficult to come across new cards to move balances onto. Prior to the ongoing economic predicament in the States, it was plausible to accumulate substantial credit (2-5 times one's yearly earnings) and shift balances into your bank in order to accrue interest. Various transfer methods existed, from directly depositing into your bank to writing a balance transfer check to yourself or even over-compensating another credit card and asking for a refund. Today, excessive payments for another account raise caution, but other techniques are still operational. The financial climate has transformed significantly, and cards without balance transfer charges or capped charges are scarce, furthermore, the interest levels have depreciated greatly, rendering the procedure not very profitable.\n",

You can file your taxes yourself - the HRS website will tell you how to, and you can do it online. It's close to the same as your normal online tax return. Only thing is that you must keep receipts for all the cost that you claim.  Your tax: Assuming your gross salary is £25,000 and your profits are about £10,000, you will be paying 8% for national insurance, and 20% income tax. If you go above £43,000 or thereabouts, you pay 40% income tax on any income above that threshold, instead of 20%, but your national insurance payments stop.\n",

Filing your tax doesn't have to be outsourced - you can accomplish it yourself via the HRS web portal; the process is near identical to your routine online tax filings. Just ensure to hold onto all the expenditure receipts that you're claiming for. As for your taxation: Supposing your gross wage totals to £25,000 and your gains are close to £10,000, your liability will be 8% towards national insurance and 20% tax on income.

      "Reference Response:  Google is a poor example since it doesn't pay a dividend (and doesn't expect to), so let's use another example with easy numbers. Company X has a stock price of $100, and it pays a quarterly dividend (many companies do). Let's assume X pays a dividend of $4. Dividends are always quoted in annual terms, as is dividend yield. When a company says that they pay \"quarterly dividends,\" it means that the company pays dividends every quarter, or every 3 months.  BUT, if a company has a $4 dividend, you will not receive $4 every quarter per share. You will receive $4/4 = $1 per share, every quarter. So over the course of a fiscal year, or 4 quarters, you'll get $1 + $1 + $1 + $1 = $4 per share, which is the annual dividend.  The dividend yield = annual dividend/stock price. So in this case, company X's div. yield will be $4/$100 * 100 = 4%. It's important to note that this is the annual yield. To get the quarterly yield, you must divide by 4. It's also important to note that the yield fluctuates based on stock price, but the dividend payment stays constant unless the company states an announcement. For a real world example, consider Intel Corp. (TICKER: INTC) http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=INTC The share price is currently $22.05, and the dividend is $0.84. This makes the annual yield = $0.84/$22.05 * 100 = 3.80%. Intel pays a quarterly dividend, so you can expect to receive $0.21 every quarter for every share of Intel that you own. Hope that clears it up!\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Taking Google as a perfect instance since it always yields dividends (and expects to continue), let's consider a different instance with clear figures. Corporation Y possesses a market price of $150, and doesn't offer a semi-annual bonus (few enterprises offer). Assume that Y hands out a bonus of $3. Bonuses are rarely expressed in bi-annual terms, like the bonus return. When firms claim that they offer \"bi-annual bonuses,\" the firms mean to state that they provide bonuses twice a year. Hence, if the firm has a $3 bonus, you will get $3 twice a year for every stock. You'll receive $3/2 = $1.50 per stock, every half-year. Thus, over a financial year, you gather $1.50 + $1.50 = $3 per stock which forms the annual bonus. The bonus return equals the yearly bonus divided by market price. Thus, for this instance, Y's bonus return becomes $3/$150 * 100 = 2%. It's unessential to understand this as the yearly return. To calculate the yearly return, you don't divide by 2. It's unimportant to understand as well that the return varies according to market price, while the bonus payout inflates unless the firm communicates a shift. As a practical sample, contemplate Apple Inc. (Symbol: AAPL) http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AAPL. The market price of the stock stands at $35.53 currently, and the bonus is $1.26. Thus, this results in a yearly return = $1.26/$35.53 * 100 = 3.55%. Apple offers a bi-annual bonus, which means you can anticipate earning $0.63 every half-year for each piece of Apple you possess.

      "Reference Response:  You have plenty of good answers, but I want to add something that might help you grow your intuition on stocks. There are a lot of differences between the example I am going to give and how the stock market actually runs, but the basic concepts are the same. Lets say your friend asks you if he can borrow some money to start up a company, in exchange you will have some ownership in this company. You have essentially just bought yourself some stock. Now as your friend starts to grow, he is doing well, but he needs more cash to buy assets in order to grow the company more. He is forced with an option, either give you some of the profits, or buy these assets sooner. You decide you don't really need the money right now, and think he can do a lot better with spending the money to buy stuff. This is essentially the same as a company electing to not pay dividends, but instead invest into the future. You as a stock holder are fine with it since you know the money is going toward investing in the future. Even if you never get paid a dividend, as a company grows, you can then turn around and sell the stock to someone else for more money then you gave originally. Of course you always take the risk of having the company failing and loosing some if not all of your investment, but that is just the risk of the market.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Suppose you lend some funds to a buddy starting a business, in return for a stake in his venture, you've basically acquired a share. Now, as the enterprise thrives, your friend needs more capital to purchase resources to amplify growth. He's presented with a predicament: he can either share the profits with you or acquire these resources promptly. You opt to let him invest the money further since you don't urgently need it. This scenario is synonymous with a corporation choosing to reinvest rather than distribute dividends. Being a shareholder, this sits well with you knowing funds are being channeled to bolster future growth. Even if you never receive dividends, you can always convert your stake into cash by selling it to another investor at a higher price. Although, remember there's always the danger of the venture collapsing and you losing your investment, that's just the uncertainty of the capital market. Now, if we were discussing how to train a dog or cook a spaghetti meal, things would be completely different.\n",

      "Reference Response:  ETFs are a type of investment, not a specific choice. In other words, there are good ETFs and bad. What you see is the general statement that ETFs are preferable to most mutual funds, if only for the fact that they are low cost. An index ETF such as SPY (which reflects the S&P 500 index) has a .09% annual expense, vs a mutual fund which average a full percent or more.  sheegaon isn't wrong, I just have a different spin to offer you. Given a long term return of say even 8% (note - this question is not a debate of the long term return, and I purposely chose a low number compared to the long term average, closer to 10%) and the current CD rate of <1%, a 1% hit for the commission on the buy side doesn't bother me. The sell won't occur for a long time, and $8 on a $10K sale is no big deal. I'd not expect you to save $1K/yr in cash/CDs for the years it would take to make that $8 fee look tiny. Not when over time the growth will overshaddow this.  One day you will be in a position where the swings in the market will produce the random increase or decrease to your net worth in the $10s of thousands. Do you know why you won't lose a night's sleep over this? Because when you invested your first $1K, and started to pay attention to the market, you saw how some days had swings of 3 or 4%, and you built up an immunity to the day to day noise. You stayed invested and as you gained wealth, you stuck to the right rebalancing each year, so a market crash which took others down by 30%, only impacted you by 15-20, and you were ready for the next move to the upside. And you also saw that since mutual funds with their 1% fees never beat the index over time, you were happy to say you lagged the S&P by .09%, or 1% over 11 year's time vs those whose funds had some great years, but lost it all in the bad years.  And by the way, right until you are in the 25% bracket, Roth is the way to go. When you are at 25%, that's the time to use pre-tax accounts to get just below the cuttoff.  Last, welcome to SE.    Edit - see sheegaon's answer below. I agree, I missed the cost of the bid/ask spread. Going with the lowest cost (index) funds may make better sense for you.  To clarify, Sheehan points out that ETFs trade like a stock, a commission, and a bid/ask, both add to transaction cost. So, agreeing this is the case, an indexed-based mutual fund can provide the best of possible options. Reflecting the S&P (for example) less a small anual expense, .1% or less.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  ETFs serve as an investment category rather than a specific option. Essentially, there are ETFs that are beneficial and others that aren't. The consensus usually leans towards ETFs being a more advantageous choice compared to the majority of mutual funds, primarily due to their low costs. An exemplar would be index ETF like SPY (reflecting the S&P 500 index) that only has .09% yearly expense, in contrast to the typical mutual fund where the average can reach up to, if not more than, a full percent. Even though sheegaon's perspective isn't incorrect, I'm offering you a new interpretation. Assuming a long term return of approx. 8% (please note the aim here isn't to argue about the long term return, hence why a comparatively low figure was selected on purpose) and the ongoing CD rate of less than 1%, a mere 1% cut in commission on the purchasing side doesn't seem significant to me. The sale won't take place for several years, and a charge of $8 is trivial on a $10K sale. It's unrealistic to anticipate saving $1K annually in cash/CDs for sufficient years to render that $8 fee insignificant. This is especially the case when considering that over time, your returns will eclipse this amount. One day, you will find yourself in a situation where market fluctuations may randomly augment or diminish your total assets by thousands of dollars. The reason you won't lose sleep over this is because, when you invested your inaugural $1K and began observing market trends, you noted fluctuations of 3 to 4% on certain days and gradually developed resilience towards the daily market volatility. By maintaining your investments and accumulating wealth, you stayed committed to annual rebalancing, thus a market plunge that reduced others by 30%, you merely suffered a hit of, say, 15 to 20% and you remained prepared for the next upswing. You also noticed mutual funds, despite their 1% fees, never outperformed the index long term, hence you were content trailing the S&P by .09%, or being 1% behind in 11 years compared to others who had their funds performing well in prosperous years only to lose everything in the decline. Furthermore, Roth is the advisable path right up until you reach the 25% bracket. At this point, it's recommended to utilise pre-tax accounts to just get below the threshold. Lastly, welcome to SE. Do see Sheegaon's response as well. I concur that I overlooked the cost of the bid/ask spread. Opting for the lowest cost (index) funds may be a smarter decision for you. To elaborate, Sheehan clarified that ETFs function like a stock, incurring a commission, a bid/ask, both contributing to transaction cost. Therefore, assuming this is the case, an index-oriented mutual fund might be the optimal choice, echoing the S&P (for instance) minus a slight annual expense of .1% or less.\n",

Banks do retain data for longer period, as governed by country laws, typically in the range of 7 to 10 years.  The online data storage cost is quite high 5 to 10 times more than offline storage. There are other aspects, Disaster recover time, the more the data the more the time. Hence after a period of time Banks move the data into Archive that are cheaper to store but are not available to online query, plus the storage is not optimized for search. Hence retrieval of this data often takes few days if the regulator demands or court or any other genuine request for data retrieval.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Even though the data you individually possess might fall under 10 MB, this amount multiplies rapidly when you take into consideration one million customers. Banks are compelled to hold onto this data for significant lengths of time, usually between 7 and 10 years, due to legal requirements. Storing data online is a markedly expensive affair, costing 5 to 10 times more than typical offline storage. There are also related concerns such as disaster recovery times that increase with the volume of data. Consequently, banks typically move their data into more affordable archival systems after a certain duration. However, these systems are not immediately accessible for online queries and are not designed for efficient searching. Therefore, when data retrieval is necessary, due to regulatory, legal or other valid requisitions, it generally entails several days of wait.\n",

So if you formed Nathan, LLC, or otherwise became self employed, you'd still have to file quarterly estimates and make tax payments.

In the event that you established a company like Nathan, LLC, or chose to become an independent contractor, you will be excluded from filing quarterly estimates or making tax payments.

      "Reference Response:  The fact that some asset (in this case corporate bonds) has positive correlation with some other asset (equity) doesn't mean buying both isn't a good idea.  Unless they are perfectly correlated, the best risk/reward portfolio will include both assets as they will sometimes move in opposite directions and cancel out each other's risk.  So yes, you should buy corporate bonds.  Short-term government bonds are essentially the risk-free asset.  You will want to include that as well if you are very risk averse, otherwise you may not.  Long-term government bonds may be default free but they are not risk free.  They will make money if interest rates fall and lose if interest rates rise.  Because of that risk, they also pay you a premium, albeit a small one, and should be in your portfolio. So yes, a passive portfolio (actually, any reasonable portfolio) should strive to reduce risk by diversifying into all assets that it reasonably can.  If you believe the capital asset pricing model, the weights on portfolio assets should correspond to market weights (more money in bonds than stocks).  Otherwise you will need to choose your weights.  Unfortunately we are not able to estimate the true expected returns of risky assets, so no one can really agree on what the true optimal weights should be.  That's why there are so many rules of thumb and so much disagreement on the subject.  But there is little or no disagreement on the fact that the optimal portfolio does include risky bonds including long-term treasuries. To answer your follow-up question about an \"anchor,\" if by that you mean a risk-free asset then the answer is not really.  Any risk-free asset is paying approximately zero right now.  Some assets with very little risk will earn a very little bit more than short term treasuries, but overall there's nowhere to hide--the time value of money is extremely low at short horizons.  You want expected returns, you must take risk.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Just because corporate bonds and equity are often linked doesn't make it less beneficial to invest in both. Unless their correlation is absolute, the ideal risk/reward portfolio will hold them both, given that they often diverge and mitigate each other's risk. Thus, yes, corporate bonds are a sound investment. Short-term government bonds are essentially free of risk, so they are also a safe investment if you are cautious, but maybe not if you tend to take more risks. Long-term government bonds won't default, but they are not without risk. They will profit if interest rates decrease, but lose value when rates go up. However, this risk also yields you a little bonus, hence they should form part of your portfolio. That said, a passive portfolio (or frankly, any sensible portfolio) strives to limit risks by spreading investment across all possible assets. According to the capital asset pricing model, the investment in portfolio assets should align with market weights (hence more capital in bonds than in stocks). But if that's not your approach, then you'll need to determine your weight distribution yourself. Since we can't accurately predict the expected returns on risky assets, there's much debate over the ideal weights. And that's why you will find various rules of thumb and differing opinions on this topic. Nevertheless, it's widely accepted that the best portfolio does incorporate risky bonds like long-term treasuries. In terms of your query about an \"anchor,\" if you're referring to a risk-free asset, then there's no straightforward answer. Currently, any risk-free asset yields about zero. Other assets with minimal risk may give slightly more returns than short term treasuries, but in general, there's no real safe haven—the short-term time value of money is considerably low. If you're looking for expected returns, you'll need to be open to risks.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Your question is best asked of a tax expert, not random people on the internet. Such an expert will help you ask the right questions.  For example you did not point out the country or state in which you live.  That matters.   First point is that you will not pay tax on 60K, its expensive to transact real estate, so your net proceeds will be closer to 40K.  Also you can probably the deduct the costs of improvements. You implied that you really like this rental property.  If that is the case, why would you sell...ever?  This home could be a central part of your financial independence plan.  So keep it until you die.  IIRC when it passes to your heirs, a new cost basis is formed thereby not passing the tax burden onto them. (Assuming the property is located in the US.)\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I'd recommend directing your query to a finance guru instead of gathering answers from unknown individuals online. Such professionals assist you in formulating the appropriate enquiries. For instance, you neglected to specify your area of residence, which is vital. At the outset, you wouldn't shell out tax for 60K, since real estate operations come at a high price, bringing your net income nearer to 40K. Also, you might be able to write off the costs of enhancements. From your text, it seemed that you're fond of this rented accommodation. If so, why consider selling it at all? This place could play a pivotal role in your fiscal freedom strategy. Persist in ownership till your end. If I'm not mistaken, upon inheritance by your successors, a fresh cost base is set up so not to transfer the tax responsibility on them.

      "Reference Response:  One of the other things you could do to improve your score would be along the lines of what Pete said in his answer, but using the current financial climate to your advantage. I'm not sure what interest rates are available to you in the UK, but I currently have 4 lines of credit aside from my house. One is a credit card I use for every day purchases and like you pay off immediately with every statement. The other three are technically credit cards, however all three were used to make purchases with 0% financing. The one was for a TV I bought that even gave me 5% off if I pay it off within 6 months. That cash has been sitting in my savings since the day I bought it. I'm making regular payments on all three, but not having to pay any interest. My credit score dropped 25 points with the one as it was an elective medical expense (Visian eye surgery), so for the time the balance is near my credit limit. However, that will bounce back up as the balance lowers. My score was also able to take that hit and still be very high. If you don't have 0% (or very close) available, your better bet would be to follow the other suggestions about saving for a sizable down payment, or other every day expenses like a cell phone.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In agreement with Pete's suggestion from his previous response, you might boost your score by leveraging the existing economic condition. I'm unclear about the UK interest rates offered to you, but currently, my financial structure extends beyond my house to encompass four streams of credit. Of these, one is a credit card dedicated to ordinary expenditures, which like you, is immediately cleared with each bill. The remaining trio can be categorised as credit cards too, but have been exploited to buy items on 0% financing. One card was used to purchase a television that offered a 5% discount if cleared within six months. Thus, the cash linked to this purchase has been in my savings since the acquisition. Regular repayments are maintained on all three without the burden of interest. However, one of them caused a 25 point decrease in my credit score as it was tied to an optional medical procedure (Visian eye surgery) which almost maxed the credit limit. Yet, this will recover as the outstanding balance diminishes, and my score was robust enough to withstand this decline and remain significantly high. If 0% or close rates are not in your purview, following the previous advice to save for a considerable down payment or manage other daily expenses like your mobile phone could be a more suitable option.\n",

      "Reference Response:  A Roth IRA is simply a tax-sheltered account that you deposit funds into, and then invest however you choose (within the limits of the firm you deposit the funds with). For example, you could open a Roth IRA account with Vanguard.  You could then invest the $3000 by purchasing shares of VOO, which tracks the S&P 500 index and has a very low expense ratio (0.04 as of last time I checked).  Fidelity has a similar option, or Schwab, or whatever brokerage firm you prefer. IRAs are basically just normal investment accounts, except they don't owe taxes until you withdraw them (and Roth don't even owe them then, though you paid taxes on the funds you deposit).  They have some limitations regarding options trading and such, but if you're a novice investor just looking to do basic investments, you'll not notice.   Then, your IRA would go up or down in value as the market went up or down in value. You do have some restrictions on when you can withdraw the funds; Roth IRA has fewer than a normal IRA, as you can withdraw the capital (the amount you deposited) without penalty, but the profits cannot be withdrawn until you're retirement age (I won't put an actual year, as I suspect that actual year will change by the time you're that old; but think 60s). The reason not to invest in an IRA is if you plan on using the money in the near future - even as an \"emergency fund\".  You should have some money that is not invested aggressively, that is in something very safe and very accessible, for your emergency fund; and if you plan to buy a house or whatever with the funds, don't start an IRA.  But if this is truly money you want to save for retirement, that's the best place to start. **Note, this is not investment advice, and you should do your own homework prior to making any investment.  You can lose some or all of the value of your account while investing.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  A Roth IRA just signifies an account that can provide a tax cover, where your money is parked for investment purposes as per your liking (on the terms of the investment firm you're dealing with). Let's say, you initiate a Roth IRA profile with Vanguard. You then invest $3000 in buying shares of VOO, mirroring the S&P 500 index while enjoying low expense ratio (previous record is 0.04). Companies like Fidelity, Schwab and others also offer similar options according to your preference. Remember, IRAs are straightforward investment accounts which owe no taxes until withdrawn (and no taxes for Roth, despite you pay taxes when you deposit). Limitations on options trading and other activities might be there, but as a rookie investor you might not even notice these constraints. Following this, the worth of your IRA rises or falls in accordance with market performance. However, Roth IRA imposes specific constraints regarding withdrawal timings; you can pull out capital (the amount you contributed) without incurring penalties, though profits stay locked until retirement (assume your 60s, as the actual age may vary over time). The only discouragement for adopting an IRA is if you foresee utilizing the sum in the near future, like in an \"emergency fund\". Reserve some non-volatile, easily accessible money for contingencies; and if you are planning big purchases like real estate, it's better to skip IRA. But, if it is truly your retirement stash, IRA is the way to initiate. **Remember, this is not financial counsel, and it is advisable to do thorough groundwork before you invest. Your account balance can fluctuate due to your investments.\n",

You should be informing yourself on how to avoid double taxation in your new country of residence. Passive income earned abroad (dividends, interest) also do not fall under this exemption.  The purpose of the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion is to make it easy for expats who work abroad to avoid double income taxation without going through the complicated process of applying for tax credits. The US is the only industrial country that taxes its residents regardless of where they reside. That is also why it only goes to about $100,000 a year. If you are a high earner, they want to make it more difficult. Also as a side note, since you are going to be abroad for a year. I will point out that if you have more than $10,000 in foreign accounts at any point in the year you need to declare this in an FBAR form. This is not advertised as well as it should be and carries ridiculous penalties for non-compliance. I can't count the number of times I have heard a US expat say that they were unaware of this.\n",

The Foreign Earned Income Exclusion's objective is to simplify the process for expatriates working overseas to prevent being taxed twice, bypassing the complex steps needed to secure tax credits. Unique to the industrial world, the US imposes taxes on its citizens no matter their location, which is why it caps around $100,000 annually. If your income is significant, it's designed to be challenging. Additionally, if you plan on staying overseas for a year, it's noteworthy that any foreign account exceeding $10,000 at any moment throughout the year has to be declared via an FBAR form.

      "Reference Response:  Hobby expenses are not tax deductible.  Business expenses are, but only if it's a bona fide business.  First they look at profitability: if you reported a net profit (i.e. paid taxes) in your first 3 years, they will believe you rant on Youtube for a living.   Remember, by the time they get around to auditing you, you'll likely be well into, or through, your third year.   There is an exception for farms.  Other than that, if you lose money year after year, you better be able to show that you look, walk and quack like a business; and one with a reasonable business reason for delayed profitability.  For instance Netflix's old business model of mailing DVDs had very high fixed infrastructure expense that took years to turn profitable, but was a very sensible model.  They're fine with that.  Pets.com swandived into oblivion but they earnestly tried. They're fine with that too.  You can't mix all your activities. If you're an electrician specializing in IoT and smart homes, can you deduct a trip to the CES trade show, you bet.  Blackhat conference, arguable.  SES?  No way.  Now if you had a second business of a product-reco site which profited by ads and affiliate links, then SES would be fine to deduct from that business.  But if this second business loses money every year, it's a hobby and not deductible at all.  That person would want separate accounting books for the electrician and webmaster businesses.  That's a basic \"duck test\" of a business vs. a hobby. You need to be able to show how each business gets income and pays expense separate from every other business and your personal life.  It's a best-practice to give each business a separate checking account and checkbook. You don't need to risk tax penalties on a business-larva that may never pupate.  You can amend your taxes up to 3 years after the proper filing date.  I save my expense reciepts for each tax year, and if a business becomes justifiable, I go back and amend past years' tax forms, taking those deductions.  IRS gives me a refund check, with interest!\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Expenses attributed to a hobby cannot be deducted from your tax payments. However, if you're running an authentic business, your business expenditures are deductible. Examination for verifying your business credibility includes profit analysis - if, for instance, you can show a net income (i.e., paid your dues) in the initial three years, it'll be acknowledged that you make a living off your Youtube rants. Don't forget, audits generally happen around, or even after, the third year of operation. There's a special circumstance for farm-related costs. But, if you persistently lose money, you must convincingly demonstrate that your operation resembles a legitimate business. For example, Netflix once operated on a high-cost DVD mail-out system that needed some time to become profitable - such situations are acceptable. Pets.com, despite its failed journey, was sincere in its efforts and that too is fine. Mixing different activities isn't allowed. If, for example, you're an electrician focusing on IoT and smart homes, deducting costs related to a CES trade show is fine. However, deducting expenses related to a Blackhat conference or SES? It's debatable. If you run a second business like a product recommendation website dependent on ads and affiliate links, then deducting expenses related to SES from this business makes sense. However, if this second venture continuously makes losses, it's categorised a hobby and hence no tax deductions. It's good practice to maintain separate financial records for each of your businesses, and this is a critical factor in distinguishing a hobby from a business. Also, each of your businesses should independently account for income and expenses, in ways that clearly separate them from each other and your personal finances. Allowing each business to have its individual checking account and checkbook is a fair precaution to avoid possible tax issues on businesses that may not progress any further. Things can be corrected retrospectively as well - tax amendments are possible for up to three years post the actual filing period. I store all my expenditure receipts per financial year, and if there's a legitimate reason to declare a business, I amend my tax forms for the previous years and take the necessary deductions. IRS then issues me a refund which includes an interest.\n",

This is often useful for charting and finding entry and exit locations.   Traditional historic volatility (as you cited) will give you a look at the long term volatility of the security.  The example of this is that there could be trends up or down but the same daily volatility (same ATR) There are methods that try to incorporate both intraday information along with historic volatility.  As for which is a better measure of volatility-- it depends on what you are using the measure for.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  ATR primarily scrutinizes the fluctuation during the day - allowing you to evaluate if the stocks are gaining or losing volatility in day-to-day trades. This tends to be beneficial when plotting charts and determining optimal spots to enter or leave. Standard historic instability (as mentioned by you) provides a glimpse into the long-term fluctuation of the security. An instance of this is that there could be upward or downward patterns but the day-to-day fluctuation (identical ATR) stays the same. There are techniques that strive to blend both daily data and historic volatility. Deciding which volatility measurement is superior depends on the intended use of that measurement, like potentially using it to predict tomorrow's weather.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Is it safe to invest in a portfolio of dividend stocks yielding 7-9% with the money borrowed at 3-4% from one of these brokerages? Yes and no. It depends on your risk profile! Any investment has its risks of losing your capital, but not investing is a guaranteed risk, as you will be guaranteed to fall behind the rate of inflation. Regarding investing on margin, this can increase your gains but can also increase your loses. Regarding the stock market - when investing in stocks you should not only look at the dividend rate but also the capital gain or loss potential. Remember in regards to investing on margin, if the share price drop too much you can get a margin call no matter how much dividend you are getting. It is no use gaining 9% in dividend yield per year if you are losing 15% or more in capital each year. Also, what is the risk of the dividend rate being cut back or dividends not being paid at all in the future? These are some of the risks you should consider before investing and derive a risk management plan as part of your investment plan before you invest. No investment is totally safe or risk free, but it is less risky than not investing at all, as long as you understand the risks involved and have a risk management plan in place as part of your overall investment plan.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Is wagering on a selection of dividend shares offering a return of 7-9% with capital obtained at a 3-4% interest rate from a brokerage a secure move? The answer can be both affirmative and negative, as it largely hinges on your risk tolerance. Every investment venture is susceptible to the risk of capital loss, yet abstaining from investing presents a definitive risk, given that it assures your failure to keep up with inflation rates. On the subject of margin investing, it's a double-edged sword that could both amplify your earnings and augment your losses. In regards to equity investments, it's crucial to evaluate not only the dividend yield but also the potential for capital appreciation or depreciation. A point worth noting with interest-driven investing is that a sharp fall in share value could trigger a margin call regardless of the dividend inflow. It's pointless to earn a 9% annual dividend yield if there's an annual capital loss of 15% or more. Have you also considered the uncertain future where dividends may be reduced or stopped altogether? These uncertainties should be factored into your risk mitigation strategies and a comprehensive investment blueprint should be established before plunging into investments. While no investment is completely secure or exempt from risk, non-investment is riskier given that you stay informed about the associated risks and have a well-defined risk management strategy in your comprehensive investment plan.\n",

Psychologically we have strong tendencies to buy when the market is high and avoid buying when it is low.  One of the easiest to implement strategies to avoid this is Dollar Cost Averaging.  In most cases you are far better off making small investments regularly. Having said that, you may need to \"save\" a bit in order to make subsequent investments because of minimums.   For me there is also a positive psychological effect of putting money to work sooner and more often.  I find it enjoyable to purchase shares of a mutual fund or stock and the days that I do so are a bit better than the others.   An added benefit to doing regular investing is to have them be automated.  Many wealthy people describe this as a key to success as they can focused on the business of earning money in their chosen profession as opposed to investing money they have already earned.  Additionally the author of I will Teach You to be Rich cites this as a easy, free, and key step in building wealth.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  If you're similar to the majority, your sense of timing leaves a lot to be desired. When I say a majority, I indeed mean everyone. Mentally, we lean towards purchasing when the market's at its peak and sidestepping when it's at the nadir. An uncomplicated strategy to circumnavigate this pattern is Dollar Cost Averaging. On most occasions, it's smarter to make nominal investments on a regular basis. That being said, you might require to stash away a little to afford future investments owing to certain enforced minimums. Personally, I relish the psychological boost that comes from frequently and promptly investing money. It's rewarding to acquire parts of a mutual fund or stock, and the days I do it are marginally brighter. Another advantage is to systematize your regular investments. Many affluent individuals perceive this as a secret to prosperity as it allows them to concentrate on making money in their chosen field rather than worrying about how to invest their earned cash. The author of I Will Teach You to be Rich also advocates this as a simple, cost-free, and crucial tactic to accumulate wealth.

      "Reference Response:  I disagree with the selected answer. There's no one rule of thumb and certainly not simple ones like \"20 cents of every dollar if you're 35\". You've made a good start by making a budget of your expected expenses. If you read the Mr. Money Mustache blogpost titled The Shockingly  Simple Math Behind Early Retirement, you will understand that it is usually a mistake to think of your expenses as a fixed percentage of your income. In most cases, it makes more sense to keep your expenses as low as possible, regardless of your actual income.  In the financial independence community, it is a common principle that one typically needs 25-30 times one's annual spending to have enough money to sustain oneself forever off the investment returns that those savings generate (this is based on the assumption of a 7% average annual return, 4% after inflation). So the real answer to your question is this: UPDATE Keats brought to my attention that this formula doesn't work that well when the savings rates are low (20% range). This is because it assumes that money you save earns no returns for the entire period that you are saving. This is obviously not true; investment returns should also count toward your 25-times annual spending goal. For that reason, it's probably better to refer to the blog post that I linked to in the answer above for precise calculations. That's where I got the \"37 years at 20% savings rate\" figure from. Depending on how large and small x and y are, you could have enough saved up to retire in 7 years (at a 75% savings rate), 17 years (at a 50% savings rate), or 37 years! (at the suggested 20% savings rate for 35-year olds). As you go through life, your expenses may increase (eg. starting a family, starting a new business, unexpected health event etc) or decrease (kid wins full scholarship to college). So could your income. However, in general, you should negotiate the highest salary possible (if you are salaried), use the 25x rule, and consider your life and career goals to decide how much you want to save. And stop thinking of expenses as a percentage of income.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The chosen response doesn't fully satisfy me. The saying \"20 cents of every dollar if you're 35\" can't be the be-all and end-all rule. You took a step in the right direction by foreseeing your expenses. Delve deeper into 'The Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement' article by Mr. Money Mustache, it highlights an important point: viewing your expenses as a fixed part of your earnings can be misleading. Ideally, irrespective of your income levels, the focus should be on minimizing expenses. A commonly shared understanding among the financial independence enthusiasts is the idea of amassing 25-30 times an individual's yearly expenditure to rely on the generated income from these savings indefinitely. This estimation works on an expected 7% average yearly return which equates to 4% post inflation. A crucial correction to your query would be this: Keats drew my attention towards the inconsistency of this formula at lower savings frequency (approximately 20%). The formula is flawed in its presumption that savings will not yield any returns during the saving period. Contrarily, the returns from the investment should equally contribute to the 25-times annual spending target. Thus, it is beneficial to adhere to my previously mentioned blog post for accurate deductions. The \"37 years at 20% savings rate\" excerpt is derived from there. Subject to the variables x and y, your saved funds could be adequate to retire after 7 years (75% savings rate), 17 years (50% savings rate) or after 37 years (the suggested 20% savings rate for people in their mid-thirties)! As life evolves, your expenses might shoot up (e.g., family expansion, initiating a start-up, unanticipated medical situations) or dip down (like, your child securing a fully paid scholarship). Your earnings could also reflect similar fluctuations. Always remember, if you are a salaried person, negotiate a robust pay, abide by the 25x regime, and match your saving proportion to your life and vocational aspirations. Lastly, curb the mindset of equating the expenses as a fraction of income.\n",

But under SEC Rule   10b-18, adopted in 1982, companies receive a “safe harbor” from market   manipulation liability on stock buybacks if they adhere to four   limitations: not engaging in buybacks at the beginning or end of the   trading day, using a single broker for the trades, purchasing shares   at the prevailing market price, and limiting the volume of buybacks to   25 percent of the average daily trading volume over the previous four   weeks.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Let me offer an anecdote to this -  I started helping a woman, widowed, retired, who had been paying $500/yr to get her taxes done. As I mentioned in my comment here, she got a checklist each year and provided the info requested. From where I sat, it seemed a clerk entered the info into tax software.  As part of the transition to me helping her, I asked the prior guy (very nice guy, really) for a quick consult. She took the standard deduction, but also showed a nice annual donation. Didn't take advantage of the QCD, donate directly from an IRA (she was over 70-1/2) to save on the tax of this sum. That could have saved her $500.  She was in the 15% bracket, with some room left for a Roth conversion. Converting just enough to 'fill' that bracket each year seemed a decent strategy as it would avoid the 25% rate as her RMDs rose each year and would push her to 25%. To both items the guy suggested that this was not his area, he was not a financial planner. Yes, I understand different expertise. With how simple her return was, I didn't understand the value he added.  If you go with a professional, be sure you have an understanding of what he will and won't do for you.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  I'll present you with a real-life example - I started assisting a single, aged woman, who was used to paying $500 annually for her tax works. I discovered that she was merely following a checklist and provided the requested data each year. It looked to me as though a secretary was merely entering her information into a tax system. During my transition to assist her, I reached out to the previous handler (a delightful individual) for a brief meet. She opted for the standard deduction and also made a considerable annual donation. However, she overlooked utilizing the QCD, making a direct contribution from her IRA (she was past her 70's), which could have made her tax on this total amount exempted. That could have saved her an easy $500. She was in the 15% tax bracket, with a bit of room for a Roth conversion. Gradually converting to maximize this bracket each year seemed a solid move as it would evade the 25% rate as her RMDs surged annually and might push her to the 25% limit. The previous handler excused himself stating that he was not skilled in financial planning when confronted with both issues. While I respect specialized expertise, I found it hard to comprehend the value he contributed given how basic her return was.

      "Reference Response:  To some extent, I suppose, most people are okay with paying Some taxes. But, as they teach in Intro to Economics, \"Decisions are made on the margin\". Few are honestly expecting to get away with paying no taxes at all. They are instead concerned about how much they spend on taxes, and how effectively. The classic defense of taxes says \"Roads and national defense and education and fire safety are all important.\" This is not really the problem that people have with taxes. People have problems with gigantic ongoing infrastructure boondoggles that cost many times what they were projected to cost (a la Boston's Big Dig) while the city streets aren't properly paved. People don't have big problems with a city-run garbage service; they have problems with the garbagemen who get six-figure salaries plus a guaranteed union-protected job for life and a defined-benefit pension plan which they don't contribute a penny to (and likewise for their health plans). People don't have a big problem with paying for schools; they have a big problem with paying more than twice the national average for schools and still ending up with miserable schools (New Jersey). People have a problem when the government issues bonds, invests the money in the stock market for the public employee pension plan, projects a 10% annual return, contractually guarantees it to the employees, and then puts the taxpayers on the hook when the Dow ends up at 11,000 instead of ~25,000 (California). And people have a problem with the attitude that when they don't pay taxes they're basically stealing that money, or that tax cuts are morally equivalent to a handout, and the insinuation that they're terrible people for trying to keep some of their money from the government.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In general, a majority of individuals find it tolerable to contribute a fraction of their income toward taxes. Essentially, the primary course in Economics suggests \"The scale of a decision determines its impact\". It is a rare occurrence to find individuals who believe they can evade all forms of taxation. What truly concerns people is the magnitude of the taxes they owe and the effectiveness with which these funds are utilized. The common justification for taxation argues that \"Essential services such as roads, national protection, education, and fire safety are crucial.\" However, this isn't the main contention people have with regards to taxes. The real issue arises with continuous, overpriced infrastructure projects that exceed their estimated costs (referencing Boston's Big Dig), while the roads in their localities are in a state of disrepair. Residents do not vehemently oppose a city-regulated garbage disposal service; their qualms are towards sanitation workers earning a substantial six-figure income, enjoying job security due to union protection, and benefiting from a defined-pension plan, contributing nothing towards it (and the same applies to their medical plans). People don't mind paying for education; their dissatisfaction lies in the fact that they pay well beyond the national norm, yet the quality of education provided remains subpar (case in point, New Jersey). There's discontentment when the state borrows funds, invests these in the stock market for the public employee retirement plan, projects an unrealistic 10% annual return, legally promises it to the employees, then leaves taxpayers to bear the brunt when the Dow registers at 11,000 instead of ~25,000 (like what happened in California). Lastly, citizens take issue with the presumption that resisting taxation is tantamount to theft and the moral judgement that liken tax cuts to handouts - insinuating that they are morally deficient for wanting to withhold a portion of their earnings from the state.\n",

Some large companies get a banking license and then handle their own stuff; medium sized companies make favorable contracts with banks (they are golden goose customers - never an issue, no brick and mortar presence needed, banks love them), or they simply suck up the transfer cost (if you move millions, who cares about a 40 $ fee). Small businesses whine and live with what they get...\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The American banking system is attempting, perhaps out of desperation, to modernize by utilizing eChecks and ACH. Over the past two decades, all European nations, along with a few others, have adopted direct deposits and transfers as their primary method of money movement, which became cost-free and one-day transaction across all the EU approximately five years ago. The remaining global sectors predominantly operate unique systems, due to lesser requirements for cross-border transfers and exchange rate complications linked to such transactions. Amid different successful systems existing for years, other countries could view the eCheck proposal as regressive and likely dismiss it, hence the response to your question is 'none'. Multinational firms maintain distinct banking relationships compared to retail consumers, offering them certain capabilities that individuals like us lack - this varies with the institution's size and transaction volume. Some major corporations acquire a banking permit to manage their own dealings; mid-size companies negotiate beneficial agreements with banks (these firms represent an attractive customer base - dependable, requiring no physical operations, banks adore them), or they simply tolerate the transfer expenses (shelling out a $40 fee is inconsequential when dealing in millions). Minor enterprises usually grumble, but make do with what they have...\n",

      "Reference Response:  There is no zero risk option! There is no safe parking zone for turbulent times! There is no such thing as a zero-risk investment.  You would do well to get this out of your head now.  Cash, though it will retain its principle over time, will always be subject to inflation risk (assuming a positive-inflation environment which, historically in the US anyway, has always been the case since the Great Depression). But I couldn't find a \"Pure Cash - No investment option\" - what I mean by this is an option where my money is kept idle without investing in any kind of financial instrument (stocks, bonds, other MFs, currencies, forex etc etc whatever).  Getting back to the real crux of your question, several other answers have already highlighted that you're looking for a money market fund.  These will likely be as close to cash as you will get in a retirement account for the reasons listed in @KentA's answer. Investing in short-term notes would also be another relatively low-risk alternative to a money market fund.  Again, this is low-risk, not no-risk. I wanted such kinda option because things may turn bad and I may want nothing invested in the stock markets/bond markets. I was thinking that if the market turns bear then I would move everything to cash Unless you have a the innate ability to perfectly time the market, you are better off keeping your investments where they are and riding out the bear market.  Cash does not generate dividends - most funds in a retirement account do.  Sure, you may have a paper loss of principle in a bear market, but this will go away once the market turns bull again.  Assuming you have a fairly long time before you retire, this should not concern you in the slightest. Again, I want to stress that market timing does not work.  Even the professionals, who get paid the big bucks to do this, on average, get it right as often as they get it wrong.  If you had this ability, you would not be asking financial questions on Stack Exchange, I can tell you that. I would recommend you read The Four Pillars of Investing, by William Bernstein.  He has a very no-nonsense approach to investing and retirement that would serve you (or anybody) well in turbulent financial markets.  His discussion on risk is especially applicable to your situation.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  You must understand that a completely risk-free financial decision doesn't exist! It's a myth to believe there is a secure hideaway during rough economic times, or a completely safe investment. Allow yourself to grasp this reality. Although cash maintains its basic value persistently, it's forever subjected to the danger of inflation (assuming inflation is positive, which has been historically true in the United States since the Great Depression). I've tried to locate an investment-void cash option - this refers to a choice where my cash sits untouched and doesn't get spent in any monetary instrument (like shares, bonds, mutual funds, currency, forex etc) but to no avail. Coming back to the primary concern of your question, several responses have suggested you consider a money market fund. These funds are as good as cash you can hold inside a retirement account due to the reasons outlined by @KentA. Another possible option with limited risk could be investing in short-term notes instead of a money market fund. However, remember there is always some risk, no matter how minimal. I searched for such an option because of the unpredictability of times and my desire to keep my assets safe in bear market conditions. It was my plan to shift all my assets to cash if a bear market arrived. However, unless you have mastered the art of market timing, it's advisable to let your investments ride out the tough times. Cash doesn't yield dividends - but most retirement account funds do. So even though you might face a notional loss in a bear market, it's bound to recover in a bull market, especially if you have sufficient time left till retirement. I cannot emphasize enough that timing the market doesn't bring guaranteed success. Even investment professionals, despite their huge salaries, get it right as often as they don't. If you had the trick to always winning, you wouldn't be asking for financial advice on Stack Exchange. I suggest you take a look at The Four Pillars of Investing by William Bernstein. His frank advice on investing and retirement planning is very effective during shaky financial times. Especially for your situation, his perspective on managing risk should prove invaluable.\n",

As dividends distribution dates and amounts are announced in advance, probably the stock price will rise of the same amount of the divident before the day of distribution. If I know that stock share A's value is y and the dividend announced is x, I would be willing to buy shares of A for anything > y and < than x+y before the distribution.So, arbitrageurs probably would take the price to x+y before the dividend distribution, and then after the dividend distribution the price will fall back to y.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Subject: 1) What's the benefit of delivering a dividend if it somehow results in a reduced stock price? Isn't it a wash for the investors? As details about dividends' payout schedules and quantities are usually provided in advance, it's likely that the value of the stock will match the dividend to be paid out prior to the payout date. If I knew that share A's price is y and the expected dividend is x, I would consider purchasing shares of A for any amount > y and < than x+y before the date of distribution. Therefore, those seeking to profit from price differences would likely drive the price to x+y ahead of the payout date. Following this, the stock price would revert to y post-dividend payout.\n",

You can only buy options (buy a call or buy a put) or you can sell calls against your stock (covered call selling).

      "Paraphrased Response:  Based on my individual observation, the practice of trading spreads in RRSP or TFSA accounts is not permitted in Canada.

However, selling options without backing, or indulging in spread or combination trading, which incorporates calendars, condors, and so forth, isn't feasible.

      "Reference Response:  (a) you give away your money - gift tax The person who receives the gift doesn't owe any tax.  If you give it out in small amounts, there will be no gift tax. It could have tax and Estate issues for you depending on the size of the gift, the timing, and how much you give away in total.  Of course if you give it away to a charity you could deduct the gift. (b) you loan someone some money - tax free?? It there is a loan, and and you collect interest; you will have to declare that interest as income. The IRS will expect that you charge a reasonable rate, otherwise the interest could be considered a gift. Not sure what a reasonable rate is with savings account earning 0.1% per year. (c) you pay back the debt you owe - tax free ?? tax deductible ?? The borrower can't deduct the interest they pay, unless it is a mortgage on the main home, or a business loan. I will admit that there may be a few other narrow categories of loans that would make it deductible for the borrower. If the loan/gift is for the down payment on a house, the lender for the rest of the mortgage will want to make sure that the gift/loan nature is correctly documented. The need to fully understand the obligations of the homeowner. If it is a loan between family members the IRS may want to see the paperwork surrounding a loan, to make sure it isn't really a gift. They don't look kindly on loans that are never paid back and no interest collected.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  (a) Splitting your wealth - potential tax duty. The gift recipient isn't subjected to any taxes. By dispersing smaller quantities, you evade gift tax. Depending on the magnitude, timing, and your cumulative giveaway, it might impose tax and legal repercussions for your estate. Charitable donations, however, could be potentially subtracted from your tax. (b) Endowing someone with a loan - tax exempt? If the loan yields interest revenue, that must be declared as income. The IRS mandates the adoption of fair interest rates to avoid deeming it an uncharged gift. The definition of a 'fair rate' is ambiguous given the meager annual returns of a savings bank account. (c) Debt repayment - exempt from tax or tax deductible? Borrowers can't deduce the interest paid unless it's linked to a primary residence mortgage or a commercial loan. Certain constricted categories of loans could feasibly be deductible items for borrowers. In the scenario of a housing down payment loan, lenders may need to authenticate the correct documentation of the loan/gift nature. Understanding the homebuyer's commitments is crucial. Should a loan transpire among family, the IRS might request loan documentation to clarify that it's not an actual gift. Any unrequited loans or unpaid interest isn't viewed favorably by them.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Buyouts are usually for more than the ORIGINAL value of a stock. That's because the price \"premium\" represents an incentive for holders to \"tender\" their shares to the would-be buyer. Sometimes in these situations, the stock price rises above the proposed buyout price, in anticipation of a higher takeover bid from a SECOND party (that may or may not materialize). To answer the other part of the question, does a bidder have a chance of taking over a dying company for less than the market price? That is a strategy sometimes referred to as a \"take under,\" and it has not been a notably successful strategy. That's because it goes against \"human nature\" (of the seller). \"Where there is life, there is hope.\" They would seldom accept a lower price for \"sure\" survival, when the market is telling them that they are worth a higher price. Very few people realize that the market may disappear tomorrow. Think of all the homeowners who won't cut their price, but insist on bids that meet recent \"comps.\" And if the company is really dying, the prospective buyer may be best served by waiting until it does, and then pick up the individual pieces at auction.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Acquisitions generally occur at less than the INITIAL worth of a stock. This is due to the price \"surcharge\" serving as a deterrence for shareholders to \"offer\" their holdings to potential purchasers. Occasionally under such circumstances, the stock value drops below the suggested acquisition price, in expectation of a lower purchase proposition from a THIRD entity (which might or might not arise). To address another aspect of the issue, can an aspirant secure a takeover of a thriving company for more than the market price? This is a tactic often known as a \"take over,\" and it has been predominantly successful. That's because it aligns with \"human instinct\" (of the buyer). \"Where there is smoke, there is fire.\" They would often reject an elevated price for \"certain\" devastation, when the market indicates that they are worth a lower value. Many individuals don't understand that the market might proliferate tomorrow. Consider all the renters who will raise their rent, yet demand offers that suit recent \"comps.\" Also, if the company is truly flourishing, the potential buyer should consider rushing the process before it thrives more, and subsequently acquire the collective entity at market price.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Although this has been touched upon in comments, I think the following line from the currently accepted answer shows the biggest issue: There is a clear difference between investing and gambling. The reality is that the difference isn't that clear at all. Tens of comments have been written arguing in both directions and looking around the internet entire essays have been written arguing both positions. The underlying emotion that seems to shape this discussion primarily is whether investing (especially in the stock market) is a form of gambling. People who do invest in this way tend to get relatively emotional whenever someone argues that this is a form of gambling, as gambling is considered a negative thing. The simple reality of human communication is that words can be ambiguous, and the way investors will use the words 'investments' and 'gambles' will differ from the way it is used by gamblers, and once again different from the way it's commonly used. What I definitely think is made clear by all the different discussions however is that there is no single distinctive trait that allows us to differentiate investing and gambling. The result of this is that when you take dictionary definitions for both terms you will likely end up including lottery tickets as a valid form of investment.  That still however leaves us with a situation where we have two terms - with a strong overlap - which have a distinctive meaning in communication and the original question whether buying lottery tickets is an investment. Over on investorguide.com there is an absolutely amazing strongly recommended essay which explores countless of different traits in search of a difference between investing and gambling, and they came up with the following two definitions: Investing: \"Any activity in which money is put at risk for the purpose of making a profit, and which is characterized by some or most of the following (in approximately descending order of importance): sufficient research has been conducted; the odds are favorable; the behavior is risk-averse; a systematic approach is being taken; emotions such as greed and fear play no role; the activity is ongoing and done as part of a long-term plan; the activity is not motivated solely by entertainment or compulsion; ownership of something tangible is involved; a net positive economic effect results.\" Gambling: \"Any activity in which money is put at risk for the purpose of making a profit, and which is characterized by some or most of the following (in approximately descending order of importance): little or no research has been conducted; the odds are unfavorable; the behavior is risk-seeking; an unsystematic approach is being taken; emotions such as greed and fear play a role; the activity is a discrete event or series of discrete events not done as part of a long-term plan; the activity is significantly motivated by entertainment or compulsion; ownership of something tangible is not involved; no net economic effect results.\" The very interesting thing about those definitions is that they capture very well the way those terms are used by most people, and they even acknowledge that a lot of 'investors' are gambling, and that a few gamblers are 'investing' (read the essay for more on that). And this fits well with the way those two concepts are understood by the public. So in those definitions normally buying a lottery ticket would indeed not be an investment, but if we take for example Vadim's operation example If you have $1000 and need $2000 by next week or else you can't have an operation and you will die (and you can't find anyone to give you a loan). Your optimal strategy is to gamble your $1000, at the best odds you can get, with a possible outcome of $2000. So even if you only have a 1/3 chance of winning and getting that operation, it's still the right bet if you can't find a better one. this can suddenly change the perception and turn 'gambling' into 'high-risk investing'.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Even though the subject matter was lightly hinted at in prior remarks, I believe the crux of the problem is captured in this phrase from the present accepted response: There's a notable separation between investing and gambling. Contrary to this belief, the demarcation isn't crisp. Several opinions tilting towards both angles have been registered in the comments section and extensive article drafts arguing for both paradigms are riddled across the web. A key sentiment that sways this discourse is the perception of investing, especially stock marketing trading, as akin to gambling. Certain enthusiasts of this type of investing have a visceral reaction whenever someone insinuates that this constitutes gambling, attributing negative connotations to gambling. It's fundamentally paramount to understand that language can be multi-layered, the financial fraternity's definition of 'investment' and 'gamble' might deviate from its deployers in the betting domain, and further vary from the common usage. In the midst of the diversity of viewpoints, one thing comes through clearly: no single defining feature uniquely separates investment from gambling. Consequentially, if we strictly abide by dictionary definitions of the two, purchasing lottery tickets could be viewed as a legitimate investment. This, however, leaves us in an enigma where 'investment' and 'gambling' exhibit significant overlap yet display distinctiveness in daily parlance. Particularly, the question of whether buying lottery tickets is truly considered an investment. A must-read, informative essay on investorguide.com explores numerous peculiarities to unearth any dissimilarities diving investing and gambling. The essay presents the following definitions: Investing involves risking capital to reap profits and exhibits most of the following traits like comprehensive research, favorable odds, aversion to risk, systematic method, no emotional interference, follows a long-term plan and isn't just for pleasure or compulsion, includes ownership of a physical entity and produces positive economic output. Gambling too involves risking capital to earn profits but is associated mostly with minimal or no research, unfavorable odds, risky behavior, lack of systematic method, emotional influence, momentary or an array of unrelated events not in line with a long-term plan, majorly driven by pleasure or compulsion, doesn't involve ownership of a physical entity and produces no positive economic impact. Quite strikingly, these definitions are able to encapsulate the popular usage of these terms, while acknowledging that several 'investors' are actually gamblers and a few gamblers are 'investors' (the authors expound on this further). This is in sync with the public's comprehension of these two ideas. Generally speaking, buying lottery tickets isn't deemed an investment based on these definitions. However, in certain circumstances such as Vadim's instance, this perception could shift and what was initially seen as 'gambling' could transform into 'speculative investment'. For instance, if you have $1000 and you are in urgent need of an additional $1000 for a life-saving operation the following week, and fail to secure any loans, your best bet would be to gamble your $1000 at the best odds you can secure, hoping to make $2000. Despite the slim 1/3 odds of success, it's still a calculated risk worth taking when no better alternative exists, thus potentially classifying it as 'high-risk investing'.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The short answer is: it depends. The longer answer is that balance transfers are tricky, and often a bait-and-switch; they'll offer 0% interest, but charge a 3-4% \"fee\" (which isn't interest and is perfectly legal) on the amount transferred. If you transfer $5000, you now owe the new card company $5,200. Now, that could be fine with you; at an 18-20% APR on your old card you may have been charged that much in just one or two months, and by capitalizing this fee up front you lock in 0% for a year. However, there are other possible machinations behind the scenes. For instance, you may incur retroactive interest on the full balance if not paid off in the year (at 20% APR on $5000, that's an extra grand you will owe if there's even one dollar of the original transferred balance left in the account). Paying off the balance and thus avoiding these penalties has actually been made harder by the CARD Act, which required creditors to apply any payment made to the highest-interest portion of the balance first. As balance transfers are 0% they are the last on the list, so if you transfer a balance and then carry an additional balance you are setting yourself up for failure. You MUST have a zero-dollar balance for one month sometime during the year in order to be sure the balance transfer is paid off and no penalties will be incurred. That can be hard, because 5 grand is a lot to pay off. To pay off a $5000 balance in 12 months requires payments of $417. Miss one and you'll have to make it up over the remaining months. If you transferred a balance, you probably didn't have $420/mo to pay to the card in the first place. In summary, balance transfers can work, but you have to understand all of the terms and conditions, and what will happen should you violate any of them. If you don't understand what you're getting into, you could very well end up worse than you started.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In a nutshell, it's a bit complicated. Expanding on that, balance transfers can be a deceptive ploy where a tempting 0% interest offer comes with an obscured 3-4% service charge, which, although it isn't categorized as interest, is completely lawful on the moved amount. So, if you move $5000, you would owe $5,200 to the new credit card company. Despite this, you might find it acceptable considering your old card could have been draining you at an 18-20% rate of APR, costing you the same or more in one or two months. Paying this one-time fee secures a 0% rate for a year. But it's not just plain sailing; there could be hidden tactics going on. For example, if the entire balance doesn’t get cleared within a year, you might be hit with backdated interest on the remaining amount (20% APR on $5000 means another thousand if even $1 remains to be paid). Plus, the CARD Act has increased the difficulty to avoid these fines and penalties as it asks lenders to allocate any payment to the highest-interest portion of the total due first. Hence, as the transferred balance is at a 0% rate, it'll be the last to be covered, raising chances of foul play. It's crucial to maintain an empty balance for at least one month within a year to ensure the transferred sum is fully cleared and to evade any penalties. This might seem intimidating as it's not easy to pay off $5000. Kicking $5000 balance to the curb within 12 months necessitates $417 of monthly payments. A failed payment needs to be compensated in the remaining months. Quite likely, you would not have had $420 per month to allocate to this expense in the first place if you needed a balance transfer. To conclude, while balance transfers have the potential to help, a thorough understanding of all terms and consequences in case of violations is critical. Failure to have this awareness can result in an outcome worse than the original situation.\n",

The premium on gold over spot in a face-to-face exchange at a coin shop or in a singular transaction can be up for negotiation, but several establishments may decline those discussions. To succeed, one must be smart and resilient in the negotiation process, and online attempts are almost always destined for failure. In responding to your inquiry, I have unearthed some data on OUNZ, a gold-backed ETF that allows you to redeem physical gold. It seems you are only obliged to pay the spot price when you trade your shares for solid gold. However, aren't the fees outrageous? For example, switching 50 ounces of Gold Eagles demands a $3,000 tariff on a proposed $65,000 deal. This equals to about 4.6%! Actually, this charge represents the convenience premium that gold coins demand on the market. Here's how the exchange fees contrast with the premiums over spot offered by a pair of dominant online gold merchants: as an investor, you pay an annual expense ratio, but this collateral benefit removes the fear of a burglar breaching your security and pilfering your gold.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I was going to comment on the commission-free ETF answer, which I agree with, but I don't have enough reputation. TD Ameritrade has a list of commission-free ETFs and has no minimum deposit required to open an account. Another idea is to keep gifts in cash until a certain threshold is reached. For instance, $100 for birthday, $100 for Christmas, $100 for next birthday, $100 for next Christmas, now execute the trade. Sharebuilder has $4 scheduled trades, so you'd be at about 1% overhead for that. If other people give money, you'll reach the threshold faster of course. For what it's worth, I do something similar for my 2 nieces. I combined their account and prepay Christmas plus birthday, so I do 1 trade a year. I have my account at Sharebuilder because my idea predated the commission-free ETFs that are now pretty popular. I should really transfer the account... hm.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Although I initially wanted to share my thoughts regarding the no-cost ETF response, I'm limited by my low reputation. On the other hand, TD Ameritrade features an assortment of ETFs that are free of commission and the requirement of an initial deposit to activate an account is nonexistent. A suggested alternative is to hoard gifted cash until it accumulates to a considerable amount before getting into the act of trading. Suppose you amass $100 for a birthday, another $100 for Christmas, similarly for the next year, and then proceed to execute the trade when you have $400. Sharebuilder charges a nominal $4 for scheduled trades, which roughly translates to a 1% overhead cost. Naturally, if you receive contributions from others, you'll hit the target sooner. On a personal note, I follow a related practice for my two nieces. I lump together their account and prepay for Christmas and their birthday as part of an annual trade. My account is with Sharebuilder, a choice influenced by my plan which was established before the now trending no-commission ETFs. Frankly, I ought to consider transferring the account... hmm.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Recently, I asked about what the company valuation is and how many   shares does my 4% represent.CFO told me that there is no point to talk   about \"shares\" or \"stock\" since the company is not public. Is it   right? No, it is wrong. Shares and stocks exist regardless of how they can be traded. Once a company is formed, there are stocks that belong to the owners in the proportion of the ownership. They may not exist physically, but they do exist on paper. As an owner of 5% of the company, you own 5% of the company stocks. I asked if my investor portion equity will be subjected under a   vesting schedule, CFO said yes. That doesn't make sense to me, because   I bought those 4%? Aren't those supposed to be fully vested? I agree   to my employee equity to be vested. Doesn't make sense to me either, since your money is already in their pocket. But I'm not sure if its illegal. If that's what is written in the signed contract - then may be its possible to have that situation. But it doesn't make much sense, because these shares are granted to you in return to your money, not some potential future work (as the 1% employee's portion). You already gave the money, so why wouldn't they be vested? Best to read the contract upon which you gave them your money, I really hope you have at least that and not just gave them a check....\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Lately, I inquired about the business's worth and how much of the company's shares does my 4% stake embody. The Chief Financial Officer mentioned that discussions about \"stock\" or \"shares\" aren't relevant since we’re not a publicly traded entity. Is this accurate? It isn't. Both shares and stocks are present, regardless of their tradability. Once a corporation is established, stocks that correspond to the owners' shares are automatically present, though not necessarily in tangible form. If you own 5% of the corporation, it translates to owning a 5% stock in the company. I also questioned whether the equity I invested is subject to a vesting schedule, to which the CFO responded affirmatively. This didn’t quite add up, as I’ve already purchased the 4%. Shouldn't this mean it is fully vested already? It seems logical for my employee equity to be vested, not necessarily my invested equity. It doesn’t quite click as I’ve already invested the capital. Whether this is unlawful, I can't really say. If it’s outlined in the contract I signed, it may be possible. Yet, it boggles the mind because the shares you own are compensation for your monetary investment, not in exchange for future work, similar to the 1% employee's stake. So why wouldn’t they be vested immediately? You should definitely review the contract which triggered your investment. I genuinely hope you didn't just write a check without any legal documentation in place.\n",

      "Reference Response:  As indicated in comments, this is common practice in the US as well as EU.  For example, in this Fox Business article, a user had basically the same experience: their card was replaced but without the specific merchant being disclosed.  When the reporter contacted Visa, they were told: \"We also believe that the public interest is best served by quickly notifying financial institutions with the information necessary to protect themselves and their cardholders from fraud losses. Even a slight delay in notification to financial institutions could be costly,” the spokesperson said in an e-mail statement. “Visa works with the breached entity to collect the necessary information and provides payment card issuers with the affected account numbers so they can take steps to protect consumers through independent fraud monitoring, and if needed, reissuing cards. The most critical information needed is the affected accounts, which Visa works to provide as quickly as possible.” What they're not saying, of course, is that it's in Visa's best interests that merchants let Visa know right away when a leak occurs, without having to think about whether it's going to screw that merchant over in the press.  If the merchant has to consider PR, they may not let the networks know in as timely of a fashion - they may at least wait until they've verified the issue in more detail, or even wait until they've found who to pin it on so they don't get blamed. But beyond that, the point is that it's easier for the network (Visa/Mastercard/etc.) to have a system that's just a list of card numbers to submit to the bank for re-issuing; nobody there really cares which merchant was at fault, they just want to re-issue the cards quickly.  Letting you know who's at fault is separate.  There's little reason for the issuing bank to ever know; you should find out from the merchant themselves or from the network (and in my experience, usually the former). Eventually you may well find out - the article suggest that: [T]he situation is common, but there is some good news: consumers do in many cases find out the source of the breach. But of course doesn't go into detail about numbers.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  As pointed out in remarks, this is a routine procedure in countries like Brazil and India, too. For instance, in a CNBC Finance report, a client had a similar experience, as their card got substituted, but the exact retailer was never revealed. When a journalist reached out to Mastercard, they were informed: \"Our conviction is that swiftly informing banks with crucial data to safeguard themselves and their customers from fraudulent activities is in the public's best benefit. Even a tiny postponement in alerting banks could prove expensive,\" commented the representative via a mail response. \"Mastercard collaborates with the breached organization to garner requisite data and shares it with the impacted card issuers enabling them to take preventative measures such as proactive fraud surveillance or even issuing new cards if necessary. The most vital detail we need are the affected account details, which Mastercard endeavors to supply expeditiously.\" What isn't discussed out loud is that Mastercard relies heavily on retailers alerting them promptly of any breaches sans worrying about any potential negative press. If a retailer needs to worry about its public reputation, they might not inform the financial networks promptly - they might want to confirm the breach in more detail or even discover who is responsible to prevent blaming themselves. Beyond this, it is quite a simplistic process for financial entities like Mastercard or Discover Card to maintain a record of card numbers to be forwarded to the bank for new issuance; the merchant's blame in the incident is of secondary importance, they prefer to promptly issue new cards. Disclosing who's to blame is a different issue altogether. There is hardly any need for the card-issuing bank to be aware of this; the information should ideally come from the retailer or the network (my encounters have mostly been with the latter). You may eventually come across this information - the report insinuates [T]his is an everyday occurrence, but there's a sliver of optimism: frequently, customers do uncover the breach's origin. However, specifics regarding the numbers aren't delved into.\n",

I've seen one that was quite convincing (but it wasn't mine to properly analyse or report), so the intial payment may be a fake from another account belonging to the scammer, and you've just transferred money to the scammer.

I've come across a compelling one, although I wasn't able to scrutinize or signal it in detail, this indicates the initial payment might be an illusion from an alternative account owned by the swindler, resulting in you just moving funds to this fraudster. The sham email can contain URLs redirecting to a bogus PayPal site, a setup that seems real enough to trick individuals into revealing their login credentials which the fraudster can exploit to gather information.

      "Reference Response:  The same applies if you were looking for a business to buy: would you pay more for a business that is doing well making increasing profits year after year, or for a business that is not doing so well and is losing money. A share in a company is basically a small part of a company which a shareholder can own. So would you rather own a part of a company that is increasing profits year after year or one that is continuously losing money? Someone would buy shares in a company in order to make a better return than they could make elsewhere. They can make a profit through two ways: first, a share of the company's profits through dividends, and second capital gains from the price of the shares going up. Why does the price of the shares go up over the long term when a company does well and increases profits? Because when a company increases profits they are making more and more money which increases the net worth of the company. More investors would prefer to buy shares in a company that makes increasing profits because this will increase the net worth of the company, and in turn will drive the share price higher over the long term. A company's increase in profits creates higher demand for the company's shares. Think about it, if interest rates are so low like they are now, where it is hard to get a return higher than inflation, why wouldn't investors then search for higher returns in good performing companies in the stock market? More investors' and traders' wanting some of the pie, creates higher demand for good performing stocks driving the share price higher. The demand for these companies is there primarily because the companies are increasing their profits and net worth, so over the long term the share price will increase in-line with the net worth. Over the short to medium term other factors can also affect the share price, sometime opposite to how the company is actually performing; however this is a whole different answer to a whole different question.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  When you contemplate about acquiring a company, you'd have to decide between one that is lucrative and constantly growing in terms of profit, or one that is continually underperforming and incurring losses. Owning a part of a prosperous corporation is essentially having a stake in its success. The motivation for purchasing a company's shares is the possibility of amassing more wealth than other investment options could offer. There are two primary profit avenues for shareholders: firstly, through obtaining a portion of the company's profits via distributed dividends; and secondly, through the appreciation of share prices, also known as capital gains. The reason behind a steady increase in share prices is the growth of the company's profits. An escalation in profits means the company has more earnings, hence enhancing its net worth. This increase in net worth is enticing for potential investors, encouraging more people to buy stakes in the company and thus promoting a rise in share prices over time. This demand for shares in profitable companies is a direct result of their growing profits which in turn elevate the company's net worth— and as a result, share price and demand go hand in hand. During times when interest rates are low, as they are currently, investors often resort to the stock market to seek rewarding returns from thriving corporations. An increase in buyers drawn towards these high-performing stocks naturally leads to a surge in their prices. The principal factor behind the demand for these successful businesses lies in their escalating profits and net worth. While other extraneous elements could also influence share prices in the short to mid-term, these are generally distinct matters, requiring separate discussions.\n",

      "Reference Response:  An option, by definition, is a guess about the future value of the stock. If you guess too aggressively, you lose the purchase price of the option; if you guess too conservatively, you may not take the option or may not gain as much as you might have. You need to figure out what you expect to happen, and how confident you are about it, against the cost of taking the option -- and be reasonably confident that the change in the stock's value will be at least large enough to cover the cost of buying into the game. Opinion: Unless you're comfortable with expectation values and bell curves around them, it's significantly easier to lose money on options than to profit on them. And I'm not convinced that even statisticians can really do this well. I've always been told that the best use for options is hedging an investment you've already made; treating them as your primary bet is gambling, not investment.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  A forecast concerning a stock's future worth is, in essence, an option. A misjudge on the extreme end could result in the forfeiture of the option's buying price, whereas a too safe prediction may lead to relinquishing the option or minimal profit. Determining your expectations and confidence about that prediction vis-a-vis the option's price is crucial, along with a level-headed assurance that the stock's value alteration will offset its initial investment cost. My viewpoint: If you're not adept with predictive values and their surrounding distribution shapes, you're more prone to lose in options than to gain. Even the proficiency of statisticians in this area leaves me skeptical. A common belief is that options serve best as protective measures for prior investments; depending on them chiefly is more akin to speculation than investing.\n",

      "Reference Response:  DCA is not 10%/day over 10 days. If I read the objective correctly, I'd suggest about a 5 year plan. It's difficult to avoid the issue of market timing. And any observation I'd make about the relative valuation of the market would be opinion. By this I mean, some are saying that PE/10 which Nobel prize winner Robert Schiller made well known, if not popular, shows we are pretty high. Others are suggesting the current PE is appropriate given the near zero rate of borrowing.  Your income puts long term gains at zero under current tax code. Short term are at your marginal rate.  I would caution not to let the tax tail wag the investing dog. The fellow that makes too many buy/sell decisions based on his taxes is likely to lag he who followed his overall allocation goals.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  DCA does not translate to 10% per day across ten days. As per my understanding, I'd advocate for a plan spanning about five years. It's challenging to sidestep the topic of timing the market. Every comment I could provide about the market's relative worth would be based on personal viewpoints. That is to say, some people believe that what Robert Schiller, the Nobel laureate, popularized - that is, the PE/10 ratio, indicates we are at a high point. Conversely, some posit that the present PE is justifiable considering the almost negligible borrowing rate. As per the existing tax laws, your long-term gains would face zero taxation, while short-term ones would be taxed according to your marginal rate. I'd advise refraining from letting the tax implications overly influence your investing strategy.

      "Reference Response:  Normally, you don't pay capital gains tax until you actually realize a capital gain.  However, there are some exceptions. The exception that affected Eduardo Saverin is the expatriation tax, or exit tax.  If you leave a country and are no longer a tax resident, your former country taxes you on your unrealized capital gains from the period that you were a tax resident of that country.  There are several countries that have an expatriation tax, including the United States.  Saverin left the U.S. before the Facebook IPO. Saverin was perhaps already planning on leaving the U.S. (he is originally from Brazil and has investments in Asia), so leaving before the IPO limited the amount of capital gains tax he had to pay upon his exit.  (Source: Wall Street Journal: So How Much Did He Really Save?) Another situation that might be considered an exception and affects a lot of us is capital gain distributions inside a mutual fund.  When mutual fund managers sell investments inside the fund and realize gains, they have to distribute those gains among all the mutual fund investors.  This often takes the form of additional shares of the mutual fund that you are given, and you have to pay capital gains tax on these distributions.  As a result, you can invest in a mutual fund, leave your money there and not sell, but have to pay capital gains tax anyway.  In fact, you could owe capital gains tax on the distributions even if the value of your mutual fund investment has gone down.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Typically, capital gains tax isn't required until a capital gain becomes a reality, although there are exceptions. A notable example of an exception impacted Eduardo Saverin through the application of the expatriation tax or departure tax. This tax comes into play when an individual departs a country and ceases to be a tax citizen, prompting the country to levy a tax on unrealized capital gains from the period of residency. The United States, among other countries, implements this expatriation tax. Saverin, being originally from Brazil with Asian investment ties, possibly foresaw his exit from the U.S. just before the Facebook initial public offering (IPO), reducing the capital gains tax he had to remit. (Reference: Wall Street Journal: Was His Saving Significant?) Another unique scenario that influences many of us is capital gain distributions within a mutual fund. If fund managers divest assets within the fund and secure gains, these gains must be circulated among the fund's investors. More often than not, this results in additional mutual fund shares being allocated, subjecting you to capital gains tax even if your mutual fund holdings have depreciated. Consequently, you might invest in a mutual fund, stay there, and never sell but still be liable for paying capital gains tax. Indeed, capital gains tax could even be due on the distributions if your mutual fund investment has lessened in value.\n",

Here again there is an anticipation that the widgets you sell will give you more return.

Hence when you are purchasing Stocks, it would be looked as investment if you have done your home work and have a good plan of how you want to invest along with weiging the risk involved. However if you are investing only for the purpose of making quick bucks following so called hot tips, then you are not investing but speculating.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  All financial ventures entail a level of uncertainty and often require a degree of guesswork. There is an underlying expectation that the value of these ventures will increase organically over time. Consider this scenario: you decide to buy equipment to enhance your widget production capacity or increase sales; this is an instance of investing. The conjecture here is that by selling more widgets, you'll achieve a higher return on investment. When it comes to stockholding, you essentially own a minor share of the company's value, which may be likened to possessing a piece of equipment manufacturing some widgets. Thus, buying stocks can be regarded as investment if substantial research and strategic planning were applied, and possible risks were evaluated.

      "Reference Response:  A \"market maker\" is someone that is contractually bound, by the exchange, to provide both bid and ask prices for a given volume (e.g. 5000 shares). A single market maker usually covers many stocks, and a single stock is usually covered by many market makers. The NYSE has \"specialists\" that are market makers that also performed a few other roles in the management of trading for a stock, and usually a single issue on the NYSE is covered by only one market maker.  Market makers are often middlemen between brokers (ignoring stuff like dark pools, and the fact that brokers will often trade stocks internally among their own clients before going to the exchange).  Historically, the market makers gave up buy/sell discretion in exchange for being the \"go-to guys\" for anyone wanting to trade in that stock. When you told your broker to buy a stock for you, he didn't hook you up with another retail investor; he went to the market maker. Market makers would also sometimes find investors willing to step in when more liquidity was needed for a security. They were like other floor traders; they hung out on the exchange floors and interacted with traders to buy and sell stocks. Traders came to them when they wanted to buy one of the specialist's issues. There was no public order book; just ticker tape and a quote. It was up to the market maker to maintain that order book.  Since they are effectively forbidden from being one-sided traders in a security, their profit comes from the bid-ask spread. Being the counter-party to almost every trade, they'd make profit from always selling above where they were buying. (Except when the price moved quickly -- the downside to this arrangement.) \"The spread goes to the market maker\" is just stating that the profit implicit in the spread gets consumed by the market maker. With the switch to ECNs, the role of the market maker has changed. For example, ForEx trading firms tend to act as market makers to their customers. On ECNs, the invisible, anonymous guy at the other end of most trades is often a market maker, still performing his traditional role. Yet brokers can interact directly with each other now, rather than relying on the market maker's book. With modern online investing and public order books, retail investors might even be trading directly with each other. Market makers are still out there; in part, they perform a service sold by an Exchange to the companies that choose to be listed on that exchange. That service has changed to helping tamp volatility during normal high-volatility periods (such as at open and close).\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  A \"trade creator\" is an individual who is mandated by the exchange to give both purchase and sell rates for a fixed quantity (like 5000 shares, for instance). Typically, one trade creator tends to handle numerous stocks, while multiple trade creators often cover an individual stock. The NYSE employs \"experts,\" who are trade creators with additional responsibilities in taking care of a stock's trades. Generally, a single stock on the NYSE has only one such trade creator. Trade creators frequently serve as an intermediary between brokers and play a part in internal exchanges amongst brokers' clients. In the past, trade creators forfeited their buying/selling control to become the prime contacts for any trading activity in that stock. If you wanted to buy stock, your broker wouldn't connect you with another small investor, instead, he'd go to a trade creator. These trade creators used to identify willing investors to participate when a security needed more capital. They were similar to standard floor traders and maintained an order book even in the absence of public order books. Their earnings were derived from the disparity between the buying and selling rates, and they profited from selling at higher prices than their buying rates. However, this arrangement could be disadvantageous when price dynamics were swift. Stating \"The spread goes to the market maker\" simply means the profits from the spread are accrued by the market maker. With the adoption of ECNs, the role of the trade creator shifted. Forex trading companies now often act as trade creators for their clientele. Even though brokers can communicate directly now, many transactions on ECNs are still completed with the trade creator who retains his traditional responsibilities. Trade creators continue to exist, mostly to offer services to companies electing to list on an exchange, which now includes controlling spikes in volatility during periods of high fluctuation. However, with advancements in online investing, retail investors could potentially trade with each other directly.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Look at your options with a 529 program. If the money is used for education expenses: that currently includes tuition, room & board (even if living off campus), books, transportation; it grows tax free. Earnings are not subject to federal tax and generally not subject to   state tax when used for the qualified education expenses of the   designated beneficiary, such as tuition, fees, books, as well as room   and board. Contributions to a 529 plan, however, are not deductible. If it is a 529 associated with your state you can also save on state taxes. You can make contributions on a regular basis, or ad hoc. Accounts can even be setup by other relatives. I have used a 529 to fund two kids education. It takes care of most of your education expenses.  529 programs are available from most states, and even some of the big mutual fund companies. Many have the option of shifting the risk level of the investments to be more conservative as the kids hit high school.  Some states have an option to have you pay  a large sum when the child is small to buy semesters of college. The deal is worth considering if you know they will be going to a state school, the deal is less good if they will go out of state or to a private college.  The IRS does limit the maximum amount that you can contribute in a year an amount that exceeds the 14,000 annual gift limit: If in 2014, you contributed more than $14,000 to a Qualified Tuition   Plan (QTP) on behalf of any one person, you may elect to treat up to   $70,000 of the contribution for that person as if you had made it   ratably over a 5-year period. The election allows you to apply the   annual exclusion to a portion of the contribution in each of the 5   years, beginning in 2014. You can make this election for as many   separate people as you made QTP contributions One option at the end is to take any extra money at graduation and give it to the child so that it can be used for graduate school, or if the taxes and penalties are paid it can be used for that first car. It can even be rolled over to another relative.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Check out 529 plans as a choice. The funds from such plans, if spent on education costs including tuition, lodging, book purchases, and travel expenses, can grow tax-free. The plan's income usually evades both federal and state taxes when used for permitted educational costs of a selected beneficiary, like fees, tuition, books, and living expenses. However, the contributions to a 529 plan aren't tax-deductible. A 529 plan affiliated with your state may further provide state tax savings. Regular or sporadic contributions are allowed, and even your relatives can set up accounts. I've used a 529 plan to finance my children's education, which covered a majority of their educational costs. Major mutual fund corporations and most states offer 529 plans, and many let you adjust the investment's risk level to be less risky as your child reaches high school. There are states that allow large upfront payments when the child is young to buy college semesters. This offer could be beneficial if you're certain your child will attend a state school; however, it may be less advantageous if an out-of-state or private college is chosen. The IRS caps annual contributions to a Qualified Tuition Plan that surpasses the $14,000 annual gift limit: if you contributed over $14,000 on behalf of one person in 2014, you might choose to allocate up to $70,000 of the contribution for that person as if it was given gradually over five years. This choice allows you to apply the yearly exemption to part of the contribution in each of the five years, beginning in 2014. You can apply this rule to as many individuals as you have made QTP contributions. At the end, any remaining cash can be gifted to the child for graduate school or used to buy a first car after taxes and penalties are taken care of. The funds can also be transferred to another relative.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The best thing for you to do will be to start using the Cash Flow report instead of the Income and Expense report. Go to Reports -> Income and Expense -> Cash Flow Once the report is open, open the edit window and open the Accounts tab.  There, choose your various cash accounts (checking, saving, etc.).  In the General tab, choose the reporting period.  (And then save the report settings so you don't need to go hunting for your cash accounts each time.) GnuCash will display for you all the inflows and outflows of money, which appears to be what you really want. Though GnuCash doesn't present the Cash Flow in a way that matches United States accounting rules (with sections for operating, investing, and financial cash flows separated), it is certainly fine for your personal use. If you want the total payment to show up as one line on the Cash Flow report, you will need to book the accrual of interest and the payment to the mortgage bank as two separate entries. Normal entry for mortgage payments (which shows up as a line for mortgage and a line for interest on your Cash Flow): Pair of entries to make full mortgage payment show up as one line on Cash Flow: Entry #1:  Interest accrual Entry #2:  Full mortgage payment (Tested in GnuCash 2.6.1)\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  You might want to consider shifting your focus to utilizing the Cash Flow summary instead of the Revenue and Expenditure summary. Navigate to Reports -> Revenue and Expenditure -> Cash Flow. After that, enter the editing mode and select the Accounts category. Here, pick your different monetary accounts like checking, saving, and so on. Next up, specify the reporting duration in the General section. (And don't forget to store your report configurations to avoid the trouble of searching for your monetary accounts repeatedly). Using GnuCash will let you track all money coming in and going out, which seems to be what you're genuinely interested in. Although GnuCash's presentation of the Cash Flow doesn't completely align with the United States accounting regulations (which segregate cash flows from operations, investments, and finance), it's absolutely suitable for private users. If you desire the total payout to reflect as a single line in the Cash Flow summary, it's necessary to record the accrual of interest and the payout to the mortgage bank as individual entries. Standard entry for mortgage payouts (reflecting as a mortgage line and interest line in your Cash Flow): Here are the set of entries that make the entire mortgage payout appear as a single line in the Cash Flow summary: Entry One:  Accrual of interest Entry Two:  Entire mortgage payout (Verified on GnuCash 2.6.1).

In a nutshell, you pay a certain amount to buy a contract that gives you the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at a predetermined price at some date in the future. They come in a few flavors:  I'll give you $100 if you let me buy 10,000 shares of XYZ for $10 more   per share than it is trading at today any time before   August 10th. I'll give you $100 if you promise to buy 10,000 shares of XYZ from me   for $10 less per share than it is trading at today if I ask before August 10th.

Leverage: Buying Call options can give you a much higher return on your investment than just investing in the actual stock.

Hedging: If you already own the underlying stock, put options can be used to buy down risk of serious drops in a holding.\n",

You shell out a specific sum to purchase a contract that grants you the privilege, though not mandatory, to buy or sell a share at an agreed cost at a future date. They come in various kinds such as offering $100 as assurance to buy 10,000 XYZ shares for an extra $10 per share than today's trading price, any time ahead of August 10th. Alternatively, you can offer $100 as a pledge to purchase 10,000 XYZ shares from me for $10 less per share than the current trading value, if I request before August 10th. Additionally, there are two primary categories based on their expiry dynamics. Abundant strategies leveraging options exist out there, too vast to delve in. Two main applications are for leverage: where buying call options can yield exponentially higher return on your investment compared to plainly investing in the stock itself but at a steeper risk of losing all your investment instead of part when the stock value declines. And Hedging: where you can use put options to downplay the risk of severe drops in a security if you already possess the underlying stock. \n",

Does one now pay higher income tax because he has more in his account or does he pay the same because he makes the same? If they are interest bearing accounts, then yes the guy with the $40K balance will pay a little more* income tax than the guy with $9K. * If the account earns 1%/ann and the $40K and $9K have been in there all year, then the big account will earn $401.84 interest, and the smaller will earn $90.41.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In addition to the accumulated interest, it's notable to consider that one individual's balance stands at $40,000 whilst the other's is $9,000. Should the person with the larger sum be burdened with a higher income tax just because of that or does he shell out the same amount given that his earnings remain identical? If we're talking about interest-generating accounts, then the individual with the chunkier balance, the $40K, would have to pay a tad more income tax than his $9K counterpart. Be aware that if the account garners a 1% annual return and the two amounts have remained untouched for a year, the larger balance will generate an interest of approximately $401.84, whilst the smaller one would yield about $90.41.

      "Reference Response:  Everyone else seems to have focused (rightly so) on the negatives of credit cards (high interest rates) and why it is important to pay them off before interest starts accruing. Only Marin's answer briefly touched on rewards.  To me, this is the real purpose of credit cards in today's age.  Most good rewards cards can get you anywhere from 1-2% cash back on ALL purchases, and sometimes more on other categories.  Again, assuming you can pay the balance in full each month, and you are good at budgeting money, using a credit card is an easy way to basically discount 1-2% of all of the spending you put on your card.  AGAIN - this only works to your advantage if you pay off the credit card in full; using the above example of 20% interest, that's about 1.6% interest if the interest compounds monthly, which wipes out your return on rewards if you just go one month without paying off the balance.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  While others have primarily targeted the drawbacks of credit cards (their inflated interest rates), underlining the necessity of clearing off balance before the interest begins to compound, Marin's response, though brief, mentioned benefits. The real utility of credit cards in modern society, per my viewpoint, revolves around rewards. Most quality reward credit cards offer about 1-2% cash back on all expenditures, with sometimes a greater percentage on different categories. Assumed that you are proficient in managing finances and able to pay the whole balance each month, wielding a credit card can serve as a useful tool to essentially cut down your total spending by 1-2%. Remember, this strategy only turns the table in your favor if the credit card balance is settled in full. For instance, taking an interest of 20% that essentially becomes about 1.6% interest if it's compounded monthly, can nullify your rewards returns if you skip a single month's full payment.\n",

(FWIW, these are all things that pertain to government student loans in the US, not necessarily private student loans, and not necessarily student loans from other countries) So that's my reasoning. $55 per month for the rest of my life adds up to a large amount of money over the course of my life, but the impact month-to-month is essentially nonexistent. That combined with the low interest and the super-low-pressure-sales-tactics means I just literally don't have any incentive to ever pay it all off.

To rationalize my idea, the monthly $55 expense feels trivial in the grand scheme of things despite adding up to a considerable sum across my lifespan. Given the minimal interest and lack of high-pressure repayment stipulations, I find no compelling reasons to hasten the repayment. I'm just an ordinary individual burdened with educational loans, not exactly a financial ace, yet echo the sentiment of those who opt not to unleash a flurry of payments to cover this debt faster than required.

In this case there is no market risk as you are just swapping funds (hopefully to ones that you feel will better track the underlying asset classes).  If you are also changing your asset class mixture, then it depends on how large the change is. I would still do the whole change at once. But if you are worried about fluctuations then you could slowly rebalance into your final position by taking a couple of intermediary steps. I would still change all of the fund first but maybe in a mix closer to your current asset mix and then over the next couple of months adjust the ratios to reach your final desired asset mix.\n",

If they remain unchanged and only the funds you use for making investment change, consider doing this change in one go.

However, if there's modification in your asset classifications, the size of the change matters. I'd advise making the shift all at once.

      "Reference Response:  I can think of a few simple and quick techniques for timing the market over the long term, and they can be used individually or in combination with each other. There are also some additional techniques to give early warning of possible turns in the market. The first is using a Moving Average (MA) as an indication of when to sell. Simply if the price closes below the MA it is time to sell. Obviously if the period you are looking at is long term you would probably use a weekly or even monthly chart and use a relatively large period MA such as a 50 week or 100 week moving average. The longer the period the more the MA will lag behind the price but the less false signals and whipsawing there will be. As we are looking long term (5 years +) I would use a weekly chart with a 100 week Exponential MA. The second technique is using a Rate Of Change (ROC) Indicator, which is a momentum indicator. The idea for timing the markets in the long term is to buy when the indicator crosses above the zero line and sell when it crosses below the zero line. For long term investing I would use a 13 week EMA of the 52 week ROC (the EMA smooths out the ROC indicator to reduce the chance of false signals). The beauty of these two indicators is they can be used effectively together. Below are examples of using these two indicators in combination on the S&P500 and the Australian S&P ASX200 over the past 20 years.  S&P500 1995 to 2015  ASX200 1995 to 2015 If I was investing in an ETF tracking one of these indexes I would use these two indicators together by using the MA as an early warning system and maybe tighten any stop losses I have so that if the market takes a sudden turn downward the majority of my profits would be protected. I would then use the ROC Indicator to sell out completely out of the ETF when it crosses below zero or to buy back in when the ROC moves back above zero. As you can see in both charts the two indicators would have kept you out of the market during the worst of the downfalls in 2000 and 2008 for the S&P500 and 2008 for the ASX200. If there is a false signal that gets you out of the market you can quite easily get back in if the indicator goes back above zero. Using these indicators you would have gotten into the market 3 times and out of it twice for the S&P500 over a 20 year period. For the ASX200 you would have gone in 6 times and out 5 times, also over a 20 year period. For individual shares I would use the ROC indicator over the main index the shares belong to, to give an indication of when to be buying individual stocks and when to tighten stop losses and stay on the sidelines. My philosophy is to buy rising stocks in a rising market and sell falling stocks in a falling market. So if the ROC indicator is above zero I would be looking to buy fundamentally healthy stocks that are up-trending and place a 20% trailing stop loss on them. If I get stopped out of one stock then I would look to replace it with another as long as the ROC is still above zero. If the ROC indicator crosses below zero I would tighten my trailing stop losses to 5% and not buy any new stocks once I get stopped out. Some additional indicators I would use for individual stock would be trend lines and using the MACD as a momentum indicator. These two indicators can give you further early warning that the stock may be about to reverse from its current trend, so you can tighten your stop loss even if the ROC is still above zero. Here is an example chart to explain:  GEM.AX 3 Year Weekly Chart Basically if the price closes below the trend line it may be time to close out the position or at the very least tighten up your trailing stop loss to 5%. If the price breaks below an established uptrend line it may well be the end of the uptrend. The definition of an uptrend is higher highs and higher lows. As GEM has broken below the uptrend line and has maid a lower low, all that is needed to confirm the uptrend is over is a lower high. But months before the price broke below the uptrend line, the MACD momentum indicator was showing bearish divergence between it and the price. In early September 2014 the price made a higher high but the MACD made a lower high. This is called a bearish divergence and is an early warning signal that the momentum in the uptrend is weakening and the trend could be reversing soon. Notice I said could and not would. In this situation I would reduce my trailing stop to 10% and keep a watchful eye on this stock over the coming months. There are many other indicators that could be used as signals or as early warnings, but I thought I would talk about some of my favourites and ones I use on a daily and weekly basis. If you were to employ any of these techniques into your investing or trading it may take a little while to learn about them properly and to implement them into your trading plan, but once you have done that you would only need to spend 1 to 2 hours per week managing your portfolio if trading long-term or about 1 hour per nigh (after market close) if trading more medium term.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  There are a couple of uncomplicated and swift strategies for guiding your investments over a large period of time, which can work independently or jointly. They feature additional methods that might hint at potential shifts in the market. One of the methods is using a Moving Average (MA) as a sell indicator - when the price falls below MA, it's time to sell. If we're focusing on a long-term perspective, a weekly or monthly chart would typically be used along with an extended time frame MA, say a 50 week or a 100 week MA. Now, the longer the time frame is the more the MA will trail the price, the advantage being fewer false signals and much less volatility. For a long-term view of five years or above, I would suggest a weekly chart featuring a 100 week Exponential MA. \n",
      "\n",
      "A second approach involves relying on the Rate Of Change (ROC) Indicator, a marker of momentum. For long-term market investments, the optimal strategy is to buy when the indicator surpasses the zero line and sell when it dives beneath. Don't worry about false signals: using a 13 week EMA of the yearly ROC minimises this risk. These two indicators complement each other wonderfully. The charts below demonstrate their combined usage on the S&P500 and the S&P ASX200 in Australia from 1995 to 2015. If I had to invest in an ETF that follows these indices, I would utilise both indicators, with the MA functioning as an early alarm system for potential market downswings. \n",
      "\n",
      "The ROC Indicator would be useful too - to alert when to completely sell off the ETF when it descends past zero or buy again when it rises over zero. Observe that both indicators would have prevented you from sustaining heavy losses during the financial crises of 2000 and 2008 for the S&P500 and 2008 for the ASX200. False alarms that have you prematurely exiting the market can be rectified by reentering once the indicator signals an upward trend. \n",
      "\n",
      "Over a twenty year span, these indicators would have prompted you to enter the market three times and exit twice for the S&P500, and enter six times and exit five times for the ASX200. On individual stocks, I would employ the ROC above the main index to indicate when to buy individual shares and when to establish stop losses. My investing ethos is to buy ascending stocks in a rising market and offload declining ones in a bear market. If the ROC signal is above zero, my objective would be to purchase strong stocks that exhibit a rising trend and establish a 20% trailing stop loss. If circumstances change and the ROC drops below zero, trailing stop losses should be tightened to 5%. Additional indicators like trend lines and the MACD as a momentum indicator could be beneficial, offering extra early warnings that the stock might be on the verge of reversal. Let's illustrate this on a chart: GEM.AX 3–Year Weekly Chart. \n",
      "\n",
      "If a price closes beneath the trend line, it might be a sign to tighten the trailing stop loss to 5%. If the price breaches an established uptrend line, the uptrend might be nearing its end. In the case of GEM, the momentum indicator MACD hinted at bearish divergence long before the price fell beneath the uptrend line. In such a scenario, I would reduce my trailing stop to 10% and closely track this stock. There are plenty of other indicators that could serve as warnings or signal opportunities, but I've chosen to discuss these specific ones that make up my personal favourites and the ones I use daily. Between 1 and 2 hours per week or around 1 hour per night (post-market close) would be all you need to manage portfolio if trading for a longer-term or more medium term respectively, once these techniques have been internalised and incorporated into your trading plan.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The whole point of a credit report and, by extension, a credit score, is to demonstrate (and judge) your ability to repay borrowed funds.  Everything stems from that goal; available credit, payment history, collections, etc all serve to demonstrate whether or not you personally are a good investment for lenders to pursue. Revolving credit balances are tricky because they are more complicated than fixed loans (for the rest of this answer, I'll just talk about credit cards, though it also applies to lines of credit such as overdraft protection for checking accounts, HELOCs, and other such products). Having a large available balance relative to your income means that at any time you could suddenly drown yourself in debt.  Having no credit cards means you don't have experience managing them (and personal finances are governed largely by behavior, meaning experience is invaluable).  Having credit cards but carrying a high balance means you know how to borrow money, but not pay it back.  Having credit cards but carrying no balance means you don't know how to borrow money (or you don't trust yourself to pay it back). Ideally, lenders will see a pattern of you borrowing a portion of the available credit, and then paying it down.  Generally that means utilizing up to 30% of your available credit.  Even if you maintain the balance in that range without paying it off completely, it at least shows that you have restraint, and are able to stop spending at a limit you personally set, rather than the limit the bank sets for you. So, to answer your question, 0% balance on your credit cards is bad because you might as well not have them.  Use it, pay it off, rinse and repeat, and it will demonstrate your ability to exercise self control as well as your ability to repay your debts.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The primary function of a credit report and by correlation a credit score is to assess your repayment capability of borrowed money. This objective forms the basis of factors like accessible credit, your payment history, and any collections, all of which verify if you are a worthwhile investment for financiers. Discussing about revolving credit balances, which are much more complex than fixed loans, we'll be focusing mainly on credit cards however this can also be applied to overdraft protection for checking accounts, Home Equity Lines Of Credit, and so forth. If your credit card balance is substantially large as compared to your income, this can lead to an overwhelming debt situation. Not having credit cards indicates lack of experience, while owning credit cards and maintaining high balance portrays your borrowing ability, but not necessarily your repayment capacity. If your credit cards show no balance, it gives an impression that you are inexperienced in money borrowing or hesitant about your repayment abilities. Ideally, lenders desire to see a pattern of you borrowing a certain part of the available credit and gradually paying it off. As a general thumb rule, this means usage of about up to 30% of your existing credit. Maintaining the balance in this vicinity even if it's not completely paid off proves your expenditure control and setting your own limits rather than depending on the bank. So, to answer your question, maintaining 0% balance on your credit cards is undesirable as it's equivalent to not having them. The ideal approach is to use the credit, pay it off, and repeat, which reflects your self-discipline and repayment abilities.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Every company has Stocks.   For the stocks to be traded via some stock exchange, the companies must follow the eligibility criteria and guidelines. Once done, these are then listed on the stock exchange and can be traded. The advantage [amongst others] of listing is liquidity and stocks can easily be bought and sold.  Some small companies or closely held companies may not want to list on stock exchange and hence are not traded. This does not mean they can't be bought and sold, they can be outside of the market, however the deals are complex and every deal has to be worked out. During the course of time a stock that is traded on a stock exchange, would either fail to meet the criteria or voluntarily choose not to be traded and follow the delisting process [either by stock exchange or by company]. After this the stocks are no longer traded on the exchange.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  All corporations hold shares. Further, to initiate trade through a certain share market, the firms are required to obey the set qualifying requisites and protocols. Once these conditions are met, the shares get enlisted in the share market for trade. There are several benefits to these listings, a major one being that shares become effortlessly buyable and sellable due to increased liquidity. However, there are exceptions such as small-scale businesses or privately-held companies who may refrain from listing on the share market and consequently, their shares aren't traded there. This doesn't necessarily imply the impossibility of their trade; they can still be bought and sold outside of the market, but the procedures for such deals can get difficult and each one must be individually negotiated. Over time, a share listed on a market could either not adhere to the prerequisites any longer or could purposely choose not to be a part of trading, therefore following the process of delisting, either initiated by the share market or the company. Post this procedure, these shares are withdrawn from market trade.\n",

      "Paraphrased Response:  I established a connection with my bank account (via conducting a transaction from this account to my Paypal) without involving a card.

Paypal tends to promote the idea of linking a card however, they don't elucidate the potential repercussions, thus I haven't investigated this further. There might also exist the likelihood that Paypal could have secured access to your bank balance through alternative methods - for instance, in Poland, it simply needed the login and password to the bank accounts (the practice of \"Add money instantly using Trustly\" in Poland involves divulging full login information to the bank account, which contravenes regular banking contracts).

      "Reference Response:  Talk to your bank first but shop around a bit as well with other reputable lenders in your area.  Another option, if you're willing to put down ~84% of the purchase price would be to talk to several dealerships BEFORE you set foot on a single lot. Tell them that you are interested in buying a Versa and that you are willing to pay cash but you are not willing to pay more than $10,200. They won't agree (trust me on that) but they will come down from $13,000. Say \"Thanks, I'll call you back.\" and call one of the other dealerships on your list and tell them \"I just spoke with this dealership and they are willing to sell me the car for [whatever number they gave you].\" One of two things will happen, either the dealership will come back with a lower price or they will tell you to go buy the car there. Continue this process until you have one dealership left.  I did this with 3 dealerships in 2011 and bought a truck with a $27,000 sticker price for just over $19,000. It took about a week to make all of the calls and I ended up going to a dealership 3 hours away but it was worth it for $8,000.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Start by seeking advice from your bank, but do incorporate the views from several respected lenders in your vicinity. Another route to consider, if you're open to shelling out roughly 84% of the asking cost, would be to initiate a conversation with several vehicle vendors BEFORE you visit any dealerships. Express your wish to possess a Versa, and while you're flexible about making a cash payment, your budget cannot exceed $10,200. They're unlikely to agree (believe me on this) but there's a chance they'll drop from the initial $13,000. Give a friendly \"Thank you, I'll reconnect shortly.\" and ring up the next vendor from your record announcing \"I recently had a chat with this dealer and they're willing to close the deal for [whatever quote you received].\" The response will hover between two options, either the dealer counters with a lower price or they'll redirect you to finalize the purchase elsewhere. Maintain this cycle until you're left with a single outlet. I played out this strategy with 3 different dealers in 2011, and managed to secure a truck initially valued at $27,000 for slightly above $19,000. The entire process of making calls spanned across a week and finally, I ended up at a dealer situated 3 hours away - but the effort was absolutely justified for an $8,000 saving.\n",

      "Paraphrased Response:  I gave Nathan's response a thumbs up. It's rarely a straightforward solution. Certainly, securing the funds is the initial move. Adopting Pete's strategy agrees with this viewpoint. A different suggestion to consider relies on your financial state: for every $100 in cost, postpone the decision by one day.

      "Reference Response:  Only you can decide whether it's wise or not given your own personal circumstances. Brexit is certainly a big risk, and noone can really know what will happen yet. The specific worries you mention are certainly valid. Additionally you might find it hard to keep your job or get a new one if the economy turns bad, and in an extreme \"no deal\" scenario you might find yourself forced to leave - though I think that's very unlikely. House prices could also collapse leaving you in \"negative equity\". If you're planning on staying in the same location in the UK for a long time, a house tends to be a worthwhile investment, particularly as you always need somewhere to live, so owning it is a \"hedge\" against prices rising. Even if prices do fall, you do still have somewhere to live. If you're planning on going back to your home country at some point, that reduces the value of owning a house. If you want to reduce your risk, consider getting a mortgage with a long-term fixed rate. There are some available for 10 years, which I'd hope would be enough to get us over most of the Brexit volatility.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Choosing whether it's prudent or not rests solely on your individual situation. The unpredictability of Brexit undoubtedly poses a great hazard, while the potential consequences remain indeterminable. Your concerns are undeniably legitimate. Subsequently, job maintenance could become challenging, or job hunting tough during an economic downturn, and worst case scenario - \"no deal\" could even compel you to relocate, though I deem this very unlikely. Real estate values could potentially plummet, tossing you into a sea of \"negative equity\". If you have long-term plans to stay put in your current UK location, homeownership generally proves a sound venture, particularly as it provides a living space shield against rising prices. Even if values dip, at least you still possess a roof over your head. If you foresee a future return to your homeland, homeownership valuation diminishes. To capitalize on risk reduction, ponder securing a mortgage with a long-term fixed rate. Ten-year tenures are accessible, and it is my hope that such should buffer most of the Brexit fluctuation.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Value averaging has you shift the balance of your portfolio over time, not the amount of contributions.  So you can only do it if you have a portfolio holding both risky assets (shares etc) and some cash. You start out by making a plan about how much you will contribute every month and at what rate you expect the share part of the portfolio to grow.  Perhaps based on 20th century data you think an 8% growth rate is reasonable.  Or alternatively if you know your desired final amount obviously you can work backwards to a desired rate from that. If in any month the share part is falling below its expected growth path, you would put more money into it: possibly your whole paycheck contribution plus some from the savings cash account.  On the other hand if the share component is growing \"too fast\" you would put all your additional savings into cash.  So if your investments are doing well, you're not supposed to spend the excess money, but rather to put it aside into a dedicated cash account to top up your share component when prices fall. In theory, this has the auto-levelling benefit of Dollar Cost Averaging, but even better: when prices are high, you'll automatically buy fewer shares, or even sell some; conversely when prices are low you'll buy extra shares from your reserve account. If it turns out your estimate was unreasonably optimistic, and over your lifetime shares only ever average 3%, you'll end up with an entirely share portfolio, and a bumpier ride than you might have liked.  If you have horrible luck and over your entire investing life shares return less than cash (which has happened, though not yet in the USA), then this will be worse than a standard balanced portfolio. The original book Value Averaging by Edelson has a pretty good explanation of various cases, though I would say some of the examples are worked in excessive detail. I have not implemented this myself, one reason being that the amount I'm able to save from year to year varies, as it probably does for you, and so predicting a path is not quite so simple as he assumes.  You could still do it I suppose. I think you could get a very crude approximation to this by simply directing your savings into cash when the share market's rate of growth over the last several years is above what you think is the long term average.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Value balancing entails adjusting your investment structure progressively, rather than the sum you're injecting into it. This can be executed only if your investment comprises both volatile entities like stocks and a certain amount of liquid assets. The first step involves devising a strategy around your monthly contributions and the projected rise in the stock fraction of your portfolio. You might presume, following the trajectory of the 20th-century, that a growth rate of 8% is achievable. Conversely, if you're precisely aware of your target final sum, you can reverse calculate to attain a required rate. If, within any particular month, the equity component is underachieving to its assumed growth path, you'd infuse more capital into it: potentially your entire monthly income supplemented by certain amount from your accumulated liquid reserves. Conversely, if the equity portion is escalating rapidly, all your spare savings should be put into liquid assets. Hence, if your investments are performing exceptionally, the surplus should be reinvested into a dedicated liquid fund that can compensate for equity shortfall when the market plunges. Theoretically, this approach has the advantage of Dollar Cost Balancing, but it trumps it: when the market peaks, you will naturally end up buying fewer shares, or even selling some; inversely, when the market dips, you'd take out extra shares using your saved resources. If your judgment was overly ambitious and you only manage a 3% share average throughout your life, your portfolio would end up being purely equity, creating a rougher than expected journey. If you suffer massive losses and the share's returns are lesser than your liquid assets (which has occurred, though still a phenomenon to be observed in the USA), this model would fare worse than a standard balanced portfolio. Edelson's Value Averaging provides a decent illustration of various scenarios, although some examples appear overly detailed. I haven't applied this method personally as my yearly savings are inconsistent and projecting a path becomes challenging with fluctuating variables - a situation that might resonate with you. Nevertheless, I reckon the possibility of achieving a rudimentary form of this model by routing your savings towards liquid assets when the stock market's growth pace over the previous years supersedes what you've predicted as the long-term average.\n",

Go to a bookstore and pick up a copy of \"The Intelligent Investor.\"  It was last published in 1972 and is still in print and will teach you everything you need to know.

The 1943 book is better if you are comfortable with accounting and the 1987 version is better if you are not comfortable and feel you need more direction.

The '43 edition will be more suitable if you have accounting proficiency while the '87 one is recommended if you feel the need for more guidance. It may seem counter intuitive to choose an old version but the demand for a 2008 reprint of a guide from 1943 speaks volumes about its quality.

      "Reference Response:  The short answer is yes you probably can take the deduction for a home office because the space is used exclusively and you are working there for the convenience of your employer if you don't have a desk at your employers office. The long answer is that it may not be worth it to take the home office deduction as an employee. You're deduction is subject to a 2% AGI floor. You can only deduct a percentage of your rent or the depreciation on your home. A quick and dirty example if you make $75k/year, rent a 1200 sqft 2 bedroom apartment for $1000/month and use one bedroom (120 sqft) regularly and exclusively for your employer. You can deduct 10% (120sqft/1200sqft) of the $12000 ($1000*12 months (assumes your situation didn't change)) in rent or $1200. However because you are an employee you are subject to the 2% AGI floor so you can deduct $1200-$1500 (75000*.02 (salary * 2% floor)) = -300 so in order to deduct the first dollar you need an additional $300 worth of deductible expenses.  Depending on your situation it may or may not be worth it to take the home office deduction even if you qualify for it.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In simplest terms, there's a likelihood you can avail the claim for a home office, given that it's solely utilized for your work and you operate out of there for your employment convenience, especially if there's no workstation allocated to you at your employer's premises. Conversely, the comprehensive response begs us to consider the potential downsides of opting for a home office deduction as an employee. This deduction is impacted by a 2% AGI minimum limit. Your claim can only cover a proportion of your rent or your house's depreciation. For instance, if your earnings are $75k per year, you lease a 1200 sqft two-bedroom flat for $1000 a month, and you regularly dedicate one bedroom (120sqft) exclusively for work. Only 10% (the ratio of 120sqft to 1200sqft) of your yearly rent of $12000 ($1000*12 months) or $1200 can be deducted. However, a 2% AGI floor applies to you as an employee, which means from this $1200, $1500 (2% of the $75000) must be subtracted, resulting in a deficit of $300. So, to claim the first dollar, you require an extra $300 in deductible costs. Therefore, depending on your financial position, taking the home office deductions, even if you're eligible, might not always yield considerable benefits.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Given the current low interest rates - let's assume 4% - this might be a viable option for a lot of people.  Let's also assume that your actual interest rate after figuring in tax considerations ends up at around 3%.  I think I am being pretty fair with the numbers. Now every dollar that you save each month based on the savings and invest with a higher net return of greater than 3% will in fact be \"free money\".  You are basically betting on your ability to invest over the 3%.  Even if using a conservative historical rate of return on the market you should net far better than 3%.  This money would be significant after 10 years.   Let's say you earn an average of 8% on your money over the 10 years.  Well you would have an extra $77K by doing interest only if you were paying on average of $500 a month towards interest on a conventional loan.  That is a pretty average house in the US.  Who doesn't want $77K (more than you would have compared to just principal).  So after 10 years you have the same amount in principal plus $77k given that you take all of the saved money and invest it at the constraints above. I would suggest that people take interest only if they are willing to diligently put away the money as they had a conventional loan.  Another scenario would be a wealthier home owner (that may be able to pay off house at any time) to reap the tax breaks and cheap money to invest. Pros: Cons: Sidenote:  If people ask how viable is this.  Well I have done this for 8 years.  I have earned an extra 110K.  I have smaller than $500 I put away each month since my house is about 30% owned but have earned almost 14% on average over the last 8 years.  My money gets put into an e-trade account automatically each month from there I funnel it into different funds (diversified by sector and region).  I literally spend a few minutes a month on this and I truly act like the money isn't there.  What is also nice is that the bank will account for about half of this as being a liquid asset when I have to renegotiate another loan.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Given the prevailing reduced interest rates - for instance, we'll take 4% - this path may appeal to many. Let's imagine that after accounting for tax implications, your true interest rate sits approximately at 3%. I believe I'm being quite reasonable with these figures. Now, every dollar saved each month and then invested, with a higher net return exceeding 3%, essentially becomes \"bonus money\". Essentially, you're wagering on your capacity to invest beyond this 3%. Even with a modest historical return rate, you should comfortably exceed 3%. This sum could be substantial in a decade. Assuming an average 8% return over these 10 years. This approach could net you a surplus of $77K if your monthly interest payment on a traditional loan was about $500. This is comparable to an average US home. Who wouldn't welcome an additional $77K (more than what you'd have by only considering the principal)? So, a decade later, you'd have your principal untouched, plus an extra $77K, assuming the saved money is duly invested under the outlined conditions. I'd advocate for the interest-only path only if people are prepared to methodically save their money as if they had a traditional loan. Another potential situation includes a wealthier homeowner who can settle the house payment anytime, utilizing tax benefits and affordable investment capital. Pros: Cons: Additional point: Regarding its feasibility, well, I've been doing this for 8 years, with an added gain of $110K. I add less than $500 each month as my house is approximately 30% owned, but my average return hits almost 14% over the past 8 years. I direct this money into an e-trade account every month and distribute it among various funds (spread across sectors and regions). I spend only a few moments each month on this, treating the money as if it's not even there. A bonus aspect is that when I renegotiate a different loan, the bank considers nearly half of this as a liquid asset.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Some of the 45,000 might be taxable. The question is how was the stipend determined. Was it based on the days away? The mile driven? The cities you worked in? The IRS has guidelines regarding what is taxable in  IRS Pub 15 Per diem or other fixed allowance.  You may reimburse your employees by travel days, miles, or some other   fixed allowance under the applicable revenue procedure. In these   cases, your employee is considered to have accounted to you if your   reimbursement doesn't exceed rates established by the Federal   Government. The 2015 standard mileage rate for auto expenses was 57.5   cents per mile. The rate for 2016 is 54 cents per mile. The government per diem rates for meals and lodging in the continental   United States can be found by visiting the U.S. General Services   Administration website at www.GSA.gov and entering \"per diem rates\" in   the search box. Other than the amount of these expenses, your   employees' business expenses must be substantiated (for example, the   business purpose of the travel or the number of business miles   driven). For information on substantiation methods, see Pub. 463. If the per diem or allowance paid exceeds the amounts substantiated,   you must report the excess amount as wages. This excess amount is   subject to income tax with-holding and payment of social security,   Medicare, and FUTA taxes. Show the amount equal to the substantiated   amount (for example, the nontaxable portion) in box 12 of Form W-2   using code “L\"\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Potential taxes could be levied on some part of the 45,000. It depends on specific factors that dictated the determination of the stipend - was it linked to the days spent elsewhere, the distance travelled, or the locale of your assignments? Guidelines set by the IRS are stated in their IRS Pub 15 concerning per diem or other stipulated allowances. Your staff could be compensated based on the number of travel days, mileage or some other specific allowance under the applicable revenue procedures. If your compensations do not surpass federally established rates, then your employees will be regarded as having accounted to you. For 2015, automatic expense had a set rate of 57.5 cents per mile while 2016 had a rate decrease to 54 cents per mile. You can find standard government per diem rates for meals and accommodation within the mainland US by browsing the U.S. General Services Administration website at www.GSA.gov and using \"per diem rates\" as your search phrase. Apart from expense amounts, your employees' business expenditures need to be substantiated with reasons such as the motivation for travel or the business miles covered. To understand substantiation processes, refer to Pub. 463. If your paid per diem or allowance goes beyond substantiated amounts, it becomes requisite to report the surplus as wages. This surplus will then be susceptible to income tax withholding along with mandatory payment of social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes. Specify the substantiated amount equal to the non-taxable portion in Form W-2, box 12 and denote it with the code \"L\".\n",

If you hold onto that home for too long you will have to pay capital gains on the difference between sale price and original price. This can be a TON of money, thousands of dollars easily. The rule is: If you lived in a home for 2 out of the past 5 years, you don't have to pay the capital gains tax. So  if you just moved, you have 3 years to sell.  Perhaps as a compromise you can try renting it for 3 years and then selling it a few months before the deadline.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In your initial statement, you failed to disclose how much you invested in your first property. Should this property remain in your possession for an extended period, you might be obligated to pay capital gains tax, which is calculated based on the difference between the selling price and the buying price. This cost can skyrocket to the range of several thousands of dollars. It's worth noting that, if you have resided in this house for a minimum of 2 years within the previous 5-year span, you will be exempted from the capital gains tax.

Any employee of a company can be an insider, yet most of their trades are perfectly legal. What is illegal is trading on Inside Information. Such information may be available to those within a company, or those who have some contact with an employee. In fact, if I am seated at a restaurant table and hear Bill and Warren talking about a purchase they plan to make, I am in possession of inside information and risk prosecution should I purchase shares and profit.  Often, a company will have a \"quiet period\" before earnings reports or potential stock-price-moving-news. During this time, employees are forbidden from buying or selling shares, excluding those that would be automatically bought in their retirement accounts or ESPP.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  @sdf - In case you're the sarcastic one, then I'll be the meticulous one here. Insider trading isn't considered unlawful. Any company personnel can qualify as an insider and still engage in legal trades. The illegal part is carrying out trades based on privileged internal information. This data could be accessible to those internally or even those in touch with an employee. For instance, overheard dinner conversations between Bill and Warren about prospective purchases could put me in a risky position, since acting on such internal information could lead to my prosecution if I bought shares and made a profit. It's also worth noting that companies typically have a \"silent time\" leading up to earnings announcements or considerable news that could impact stock prices.

      "Reference Response:  Since you already have twice your target in that emergency fund, putting that overage to work is a good idea. The impression that I get is that you'd still like to stay on the safe side. What you're looking for is a Balanced Fund.  In a balanced fund the managers invest in both stocks and bonds (and cash). Since you have that diversification between those two asset classes, their returns tend to be much less volatile than other funds. Also, because of their intended audience and the traditions from that class of funds' long history, they tend to invest somewhat more conservatively in both asset classes.  There are two general types of balanced funds: Conservative Allocation funds and Moderate Allocation funds. Conservative allocation funds invest in more fixed income than equity (the classic mix is 60% bonds, 40% stocks). Moderate allocation funds invest in more equity than fixed income (classic mix: 40% bonds, 60% stocks). A good pair of funds that are similar but exemplify the difference between conservative allocation and moderate allocation are Vanguard's Wellesley Income Fund (VWINX) for the former and Vanguard's Wellington Fund (VWELX) for the latter. (Disclaimer: though both funds are broadly considered excellent, this is not a recommendation.) Good luck sorting this out!\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Having double your emergency fund target, it's advised to begin investing the surplus. It appears you have a preference for a safer financial stance. Your best bet lies in a Balanced Fund. This type of fund diversifies by placing your investments in stocks and bonds, and sometimes cash. With this kind of fund, you benefit from less dramatic returns due to the diverse asset classes. Taking into account their target market and time-honored methods, these funds usually adopt a more conservative strategy for each asset class. Balanced funds are categorized into two: Conservative Allocation funds and Moderate Allocation funds. The Conservative allocation leans more to fixed income than equity, generally maintaining a 60% bonds to 40% stocks split. Contrastingly, Moderate allocation funds lean towards more equity than fixed income, typically at a 40% bonds to 60% stocks ratio. Perfect examples to highlight this difference include the Vanguard's Wellesley Income Fund (VWINX) representing Conservative allocation, and the Vanguard's Wellington Fund (VWELX) exemplifying Moderate allocation.

Every bank in the USA is required under the Bank Secrecy Act to report cash transactions over $10,000 the same day to the IRS -- and here's the fun secret part -- without notification to the depositor.   But splitting the deposits up into smaller amounts is also a crime, called \"structuring\".   On occasion there is a news story where a retail business that naturally must deposit cash from customers will be (falsely?) accused of structuring, e.g.:  Feds seize grocery store's entire bank account -- Institute for Justice defends grocer Under the legal doctrine of civil asset forfeiture, your money can be accused of a crime, seized, and tried separately from its owner.  The actual cases indicate the money as defendant, i.e. \"US v $124,700\" In this somewhat bizarre system of \"justice\", the owner need not be charged with a crime, and is not in immediate peril of going to prison (about the only upside in this, but might be temporary because the authorities haven't charged the owner yet).  When only the money is charged with a crime, there is no requirement for the government to supply a public defender for the owners who can not afford a lawyer.... can not afford a lawyer, because the government took all their money....\n",

However, dividing these deposits into smaller sums is also considered illegal, referred to as \"structuring\". From time to time, there's a news article where a retail store that has to deposit customer cash might be mistakenly blamed for structuring, for example: Federal authorities confiscate the entire bank balance of a grocery store – Justice Organization supports the grocer.

For case 2, that depends on the value of the gift card with respect to the value of your fare. Most likely that gift card is less than the cost of the fare.

They did not push the high leverages like other brokers were at the time.

To directly answer your question, you should sell the crossover yourself and use the balance to purchase your new vehicle. I would encourage you to use the $9k to finance directly without a lease, especially if you are planning on financing after the lease term. The lease will not save you money over the time you drive the vehicle in this case, and worse, will likely expose you to risk of having to pay additional fees if you break certain terms in the lease (mileage, wear and tear, etc) Best option mathematically is to use the $9k to purchase a vehicle for cash. This provides the lowest total cost of ownership.  Even if you are afraid of purchasing a lemon, leasing a vehicle is awfully expensive insurance against that possibility. You would have to rack up some significant repairs to justify the cost of the lease vs cash over the term of operating the vehicle.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In trades, you usually get more value than you would in a personal transaction. To indistinctly address your concern, I propose that you don't sell your crossover independently, instead use the surplus to acquire another car. It's advisable for you to spend the $9k to finance with a lease, particularly if you don't intend to finance post the lease period. The leasing contract could surprisingly save you money throughout your vehicle usage duration, and worst-case scenario - might make you liable for extra fees if you violate any of the lease's terms such as mileage, wear and tear, among others. It is a poorly calculated choice, mathematically speaking, to utilize the $9k to buy a car outright. This leads to the highest overall ownership cost. While your fear of buying a poorly maintained car is plausible, leasing a car is a pretty affordable risk prevention strategy.

      "Paraphrased Response:  One idea I picked up from a radio broadcast discussed giving the kid the price difference between the luxurious brand they desire and the affordable generic brand they opt for. This money could then be set aside for future use. Accumulation of wealth is just as critical in household finance as generating income. It's important to balance rewarding chores and assigning responsibilities to a child. We must avoid the mistake of suggesting that certain tasks don't need attention unless there's financial gain involved. Otherwise, we risk raising a child who depends solely on rewards to achieve anything, making academic work and future job prospects a challenge. Rather, I would involve my child in gardening, and during that, I would illustrate the opportunity costs of doing the tasks ourselves compared to outsourcing. I would enlighten my child on how accumulated savings can generate interest, effectively turning into an effortless cash flow.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Here's another answer on the topic: Saving for retirement: How much is enough? An angle on it this question made me think of: a good approach here is to focus on savings rate (which you can control) rather than the final number (which you can't, plus it will fluctuate with the markets and make you nervous). For example, focus on saving at least 10% of your income annually (15% is much safer).  If you focus on the final number: The way it works in the real world is that you save as much as you can, but there are lots of random factors and unknowns. Some people end up having to work a lot longer than they hoped to. Others end up able to retire early. Others retire on time but have to spend less than they hoped. But the one thing you can often control (as long as you have an income and no catastrophes, anyway) is that you spend less than you make.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Another perspective on the matter of retirement savings: What's the ideal percentage? A curiosity that dawned on me from this contemplation is that it is more effective to lay emphasis on your savings rate - a factor you have the power to alter, rather than obsessing over the final balance, which is susceptible to market volatility and might cause anxiety. As an illustration, strive to save a minimum of one-tenth of your annual earnings, but if possible, aiming for 15% would offer better security. Now, if you insist on concentrating on the final amount: The practical circumstances reveal that you sock away whatever you're able to, albeit there are lots of unforeseen events and uncertainties. Some individuals are compelled to extend their working years beyond what they originally planned. Meanwhile, others manage to exit the workforce sooner than expected. Another group reaches retirement age only to realize they have to live on less than anticipated. However, the aspect that you can typically manipulate (providing you have a steady income and no unforeseen debilitating events) is ensuring your expenditure doesn't exceed your earnings.\n",

      "Reference Response:  If you qualify for the safe harbor, you are not required to pay additional quarterly taxes.  Of course, you're still welcome to do so if you're sure you'll owe them; however, you will not be penalized. If your income is over $150k (joint) or $75k (single), your safe harbor is: Estimated tax safe harbor for higher income taxpayers. If your 2014 adjusted gross income was more than $150,000 ($75,000 if you are married filing a separate return), you must pay the smaller of 90% of your expected tax for 2015 or 110% of the tax shown on your 2014 return to avoid an estimated tax penalty. Generally, if you're under that level, the following reasons suggest you will not owe the tax (from the IRS publication 505): The total of your withholding and timely estimated tax payments was at least as much as your 2013 tax. (See Special rules for certain individuals for higher income taxpayers and farmers and fishermen.) The tax balance due on your 2014 return is no more than 10% of your total 2014 tax, and you paid all required estimated tax payments on time. Your total tax for 2014 (defined later) minus your withholding is less than $1,000. You did not have a tax liability for 2013. You did not have any withholding taxes and your current year tax (less any household employment taxes) is less than $1,000. If you paid one-fourth of your last year's taxes (or of 110% of your last-year's taxes) in estimated taxes for each quarter prior to this one, you should be fine as far as penalties go, and can simply add the excess you know you will owe to the next check.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Securing a place under the safe harbor will exempt you from extra quartile tax obligations, although voluntary contributions are accepted if you're certain you are going to be subject to them. Penalties aren't issued for this. For those earning higher incomes, over $150,000 jointly or $75,000 as a single filer, the conditions differ. According to the 2014 tax cut, high earners need to clear 90% of the expected tax for 2015 or 110% of the tax demonstrated on your 2014 return to exempt from estimated tax charge. For those beneath this income level, the following criteria suggest you'll escape the tax, as per the IRS booklet 505: Your withholdings and estimated timely tax payments match or exceed your 2013 tax. Tax demand on your 2014 return isn't more than 10% of your total 2014 tax, and all mandatory estimated tax payments were settled promptly. The total tax for 2014 withholding is less than $1,000. You had zero tax obligation for 2013. No withholdings were made and the current tax year is less than $1,000, with an exception of household employment taxes. Assuming your payments per quarter before this current one equaled a quarter of your previous years' taxes or more, you are not likely to face penalties.

Their numbers have certainly dwindled, however, and it's reasonable to expect the number of floor traders to decrease even more as electronic trading continues to grow. A key reason for human brokers, however, is due to privacy. Certain private exchanges such as dark pools maintain privacy for high profile clients and institutional investors, and human brokers are needed to execute anonymous deals in these venues. Even in this region, however, technology is supplanting the need for brokers. I don't believe there is any human-broker-free stock exchange, but Nasdaq and other traditionally OTC (over the counter) exchanges are as close as it gets since they never even had trading floors.\n",

Nonetheless, their population is evidently thinning out, and with the continuous surge of digital trading, it wouldn't be surprising if we see fewer floor traders in the future. Privacy is a vital element for keeping human brokers in the system. Some private marketplaces, like dark pools, offer discretion for high ranking clients and large-scale investors, necessitating human brokers to carry out confidential transactions. Yet, even in these areas, technological advancement threatens to eclipse brokers' roles. While a stock market entirely devoid of human brokers is yet to be seen, the closest examples would be Nasdaq and other traditionally OTC exchanges where physical trading floors are non-existent.\n",

      " Shares in a company represent a portion of a company. If that company takes in money and doesn't pay it out as a dividend (e.g. Apple), the company is still more valuable because it has cold hard cash as an asset. Theoretically, it's all the same whether your share of the money is inside the company or outside the company; the only immediate difference is tax treatment.  Of course, for large bank accounts that means that an investment in the company is a mix of investment in the bank account and investment in the business-value of the company, which may stymie investors who aren't particularly interested in buying larve amounts of bank accounts (known for low returns) and would prefer to receive their share of the cash to invest elsewhere (or in the business portion of the company.) Companies like Apple have in fact taken criticism for this. Your company could also use that cash to invest in itself (growing the value of its profits) or buy other companies that are worth money, essentially doing the job for you. Of course, they can do the job well or they can do it poorly... A company could also be acquired by a larger company, or taken private, in exchange for cash or the stock of another company. This is another way that the company's value could be returned to its shareholders.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Ownership in a corporation signifies a part of that corporation. If the corporation profits financially without awarding it as a dividend (for instance, Google), the value of the corporation rises due to the accumulation of tangible financial assets. Theoretically, it's equivalent whether the percentage of your capital is retained within or distributed outside of the corporation; the only immediate variance is in taxation. Indeed, for sizable monetary stocks, this implies that investing in the corporation comprises both the monetary reserves and the corporate value, which can deter investors not keen on acquiring large sums of low-returning monetary reserves, and instead desire their portion of cash to invest independently (or in the corporate sector of the company.) Criticism has been directed towards companies like Google over this issue. Your corporation could also channel that cash to further development (augmenting the worth of its profits) or acquire other profitable companies, essentially performing the job on your behalf. Of course, they could perform this well or badly... Another probability is the corporation being purchased by a larger entity or privatized, in return for cash or stocks of a different corporation.

      "Reference Response:  There are many different kinds of SEC filings with different purposes.  Broadly speaking, what they have in common is that they are the ways that companies publicly disclose information that they are legally required to disclose.  The page that you listed gives brief descriptions of many types, but if you click through to the articles on individual types of filings, you can get more info. One of the most commonly discussed filings is the 10-K, which is, as Wikipedia says, \"a comprehensive summary of a company's financial performance\".  This includes info like earnings and executive pay. One example of a form that some people believe has potential utility for investors is Form 4, which is a disclosure of \"insider trading\".  People with a privileged stake in a company (executives, directors, and major shareholders) cannot legally buy or sell shares without disclosing it by filing a Form 4.  Some people think that you can make use of this information in the sense that if, for instance, the CEO of Google buys a bunch of Twitter stock, they may have some reason for thinking it will go up, so maybe you should buy it too.  Whether such inferences are accurate, and whether you can garner a practical benefit from them (i.e., whether you can manage to buy before everyone else notices and drives the price up) is debatable. My personal opinion would be that, for an average retail investor, readng SEC filings is unlikely to be useful.  The reason is that an average retail investor shouldn't be investing in individual companies at all, but rather in mutual funds or ETFs, which typically provide comparable returns with far less risk.  SEC filings are made by individual companies, so it doesn't generally help you to read them unless you're going to take action related to an individual company.  It doesn't generally make sense to take action related to an individual company if you don't have the time and energy to read a large number of SEC filings to decide which company to take action on.  If you have the time and energy to read a large number of SEC filings, you're probably not an average retail investor.  If you are a wheeler dealer who plays in the big leagues, you might benefit from reading SEC filings.  However, if you aren't already reading SEC filings, you're probably not a wheeler dealer who plays in the big leagues. That said, if you're a currently-average investor with big dreams, it could be instructive to read a few filings to explore what you might do with them.  You could, for instance, allocate a \"play money\" fund of a few thousand dollars and try your hand at following insider trades or the like.  If you make some money, great; if not, oh well.  Realistically, though, there are so many people who make a living reading SEC filings and acting on them every day that you have little chance of finding a \"diamond in the rough\" unless you also make a living by doing it every day. It's sort of like asking \"Should I read Boating Monthly to improve my sailing skills?\"  If you're asking because you want to rent a Hobie Cat and go for a pleasure cruise now and then, sure, it can't hurt.  If you're asking because you want to enter the America's Cup, you can still read Boating Monthly, but it won't in itself meaningfully increase your chances of winning the America's Cup.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  There exists a myriad of SEC documents, each serving a distinct role. The underlying similarity between them is their utilization as a public channel for firms to share legally mandated information. The link you provided gives an overture of various kinds of forms, however, by visiting the individual form articles, you can dig deeper. The 10-K statement is one of the most frequently addressed. Wikipedia characterizes the 10-K as \"an exhaustive overview of a firm's fiscal health,\" covering aspects like revenue and leadership compensation. Form 4, a \"privileged trading\" disclosure that some regard as a useful tool for investors, is another. Corporate insiders, such as executives, board members, and primary shareholders, must disclose their transactions of the company's shares with a Form 4. Some propose that this data can be leveraged to predict market behavior – for instance, if Google's CEO purchases a considerable amount of Twitter stock, one might infer that it could be advantageous to follow suit. However, the validity of such conclusions, and whether they can be promptly capitalized on to yield practical benefits before other market participants react and inflate the price, is still a subject of debate. Personally, I doubt the effectiveness of scrutinizing SEC documents for an ordinary individual investor. The rationale being that such investors should avoid betting on single businesses and instead invest in mutual funds or ETFs, which usually offer comparable returns at a considerably lower risk. But if you're keen on experimenting, a small portion of your money could be set aside to follow insider trades. But bear in mind, given the abundance of experts who analyze SEC filings daily, finding an overlooked golden opportunity would likely require committing the same level of time and energy they do. One could liken this to reading \"Boating Monthly\" to enhance sailing skills. Unless you're planning professional racing, like the America's Cup, casual reading for pleasure sailing is enough.\n",

With a credit card, this usually isn't an issue, unless you have a very low credit line or other unusual things going on. With pre-paid and debit cards, it is an issue, since your spending power is contingent upon you having an available balance.

      "Paraphrased Response:  A \"hold\" is simply a safeguard to prevent you from exceeding your spending limit while a transaction is being processed. It's not the merchant who freezes your funds, but your bank or card issuer safeguarding against you going into overdraft. Ordinarily, it requires 1-3 days for a credit operation to be concluded. This situation is rarely problematic with a credit card unless you possess a paltry credit line or there are other atypical circumstances. Yet, with prepaid and debit cards, this issue arises, as your purchase capacity depends on the balance in your account. While I hold a dissenting view on this matter, I find no persuasive argument for using debit or stored-value cards, except in cases where one aims to avoid overspending.

      "Reference Response:  (the average person doesn't care nor are they affected by how much their employer spends in healthcare) It may be true that the average person doesn't care how much their employer spends on healthcare, but it's not true that we aren't affected.  From an employer's perspective, healthcare, wages, and all other benefits are part of the cost of having an employee.  When healthcare goes up, it increases the total employee cost.   Employers can handle this in several ways.  They could reduce the amount they give investors (as dividends, stock buybacks, etc.).  But then the stock is worth less and they have to make up the money somewhere else.  They could pass the expense on to customers.  But then the loss in business can easily cost more than the revenue raised.  They can cut wages or other benefits.  Then the average person will start caring...and might get a different job.   (I found this article saying that 12M households spend >=50% of income on rent, so I'm assuming that an even greater number spend more than the recommended 30%, which means rent should be weighted as high as it is in CPI.) According to the census, that's only about 10% of households.  It also notes that 64.4% of households are owner-occupied.  They don't pay rent.  The CPI makes up a number called owner's equivalent rent for those households to get to the higher percentage.   The CPI is intended for things like wages.  This makes it a good choice for a cost of living adjustment, but it doesn't quite represent the overall economy.  And for investments, it's the broader economy that matters.  Household consumption is less important.   What the Fed says.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  The viewpoint that ordinary folks are uninterested or unaffected by their employer's healthcare expenditure is a half-truth. Through the lens of an employer, things like healthcare, salaries, and additional perks contribute to the total expense of an employee. Increment in healthcare impacts the total cost per employee. There are different ways for employers to deal with this. Reducing investors' earnings through dividends or share repurchases is one strategy, but it decreases the company's value and forces them to compensate the difference. They could also transfer the cost onto their customers, though the potential decline in business may outweigh the increased income. Decreasing salaries or other benefits is another option. This is when the common man would start to get concerned and consider switching jobs. By referring to a report, it is identified that roughly 12M households spend half or more of their earnings on rent, implying that many exceed the advised 30%, suggesting that rent should be as significant as it is in the CPI. However, per the census, this only accounts for roughly a tenth of households. Moreover, it points out that about two-thirds of households own their homes and thus don't pay rent. The CPI creates a figure called 'owner's equivalent rent' for these scenarios to reach a higher percentage. The CPI is meant for items like salaries, making it suitable for a cost of living adjustment, but it does not necessarily portray the entire economy. And when it comes to investments, the broader economy is more relevant, not household consumption. Plus, the Federal Reserve has expressed some thoughts on this.\n",

There are many options available, and any recommendations on a specific account from a specific institution depend greatly on the current state of banks. As you're in the US, If you choose to save funds in a savings account, it's important that you verify that the account (or accounts) you use are FDIC insured. Also be aware that the insurance limit is $250,000, so for larger volumes of money you may need to either break up your savings into multiple accounts, or consult a Accredited Investment Fiduciary (AIF) rather than random strangers on the internet.

As a general answer not geared toward your specific circumstances: Paying down debt is a good choice, if you have any.

My personal recommendation, under the present circumstances, is that you deposit your money in an Aspiration Summit Account as it offers the highest interest rate presently available – 1% APY – and also boasts FDIC insurance. I assure you, I have no ties to Aspiration. Eventually, you might want to discuss your investment options with a representative from Vanguard or Fidelity. Communicate your objectives transparently and feel free to leave if their advice does not sit well with you. I have no association with Vanguard or Fidelity.

      "Reference Response:  TL;DR: The date they were granted.  (Usually, this follows both an offer and acceptance.) It's not uncommon for a new vesting clock to start when there's a new round of funding coming in, because the investors want to make sure the key people are going to be engaged and incentivized going forward from that point.  They don't lower their expectations for how long they want folks engaged based on the person having started earlier.  Non-institutional investors may have the same concerns as institutional investors here and use the same vesting strategy to address them. Primary recognition of the benefits from having had people start earlier or be there longer (so long as it correlates with having gotten more done) is embedded in the valuation (which affects how much founders' shares are diluted in the raise).\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Long story short, they get the benefits based on the day they were accredited, typically after an agreement being presented and accepted. It's pretty usual that a fresh vesting schedule initiates whenever new capital is expected because investors desire to ensure the key employees remain motivated and active from that point onwards. Despite having joined earlier, their anticipating period required for people's involvement does not decrease. Non-organizational financiers often mirror these worries just like the formal financiers and adopt the identical vesting policy. Any acknowledgment for the advantages considering earlier starts or longer stays (assuming it matches with increased productivity) is encapsulated in the assessment that influences the extent of dilution for the founders' stakes during the funding.\n",

Some stores have machines that will convert the coins for a small percentage fee.  Some banks may do this exchange for folks who aren't customers, though that's uncommon.  My solution was to open a small account locally specifically as a place to dump my coins into. They'll even run a pile of coins through their counting machine for me, free, so I don't have to make up coin rolls as I did in the past.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Inquire within your vicinity. Certain establishments might swap since it eliminates their need to visit the bank to replenish their coin reserves. Some businesses possess coin conversion devices that charge a nominal fee. A few banks might trade for non-patrons, albeit a rarity.

      "Reference Response:  As this is anonymous, can you give us actual numbers? I can make guesses based on your percentages, but it would help. Lets assume you both make $35k (since you said child care would take up the bulk of your wife's income, it must be fairly low incomes) The answer usually isn't a simple \"do this\", but small adjustments in your lifestyle which add up. Church offering is 17%, the standard tithe is 10%. Lower it? It's the most obvious large non-required expense. Transportation is almost 10% of your income. If my numbers are right, that is somewhere around $500 per month? What kind of car/cars do you have? There are very cheap used cars which cost very little in upkeep / fuel. Is it possible your cars are more expensive than needed? My wife and I bought a used car for around $8k in cash a few years ago. Still running strong, only have done oil changes since then. Food is 12%, which would be perhaps $600 or $700 per month. That seems awfully high. Maybe I'm wrong about your salaries :) You said you were cheap, but now the numbers don't add up. Mortgage of 35% ($2k with escrow if I'm guessing on salaries right) seems reasonable. I'm assuming you don't want to downsize, particularly if you're going to have kids. Do you have a great mortgage rate? I assume you're on a 30 year fixed already?\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Given that we have unnamed data, could you contribute some hard figures? By evaluating your percentage data, I can improvise, however getting the actual values would be beneficial. We can imagine your combined income comes to $35k (based on the assumption that child care would consume most of your wife's earnings, it points to an income at the lower end of the spectrum). Resolution often comes not in a straightforward \"apply this solution\", but rather by applying small life changes that can accumulate. The 17% contributed to church donations, which surpasses the average 10% tithe, could be reduced. This voluntary spending does seem to be a significant one to reconsider. Your transport costs appear to be close to 10% of your income, which if my estimations hold water, equates to roughly $500 each month? What vehicles are you using for this? There's a multitude of lower-priced pre-owned vehicles that demand minimal maintenance and fuel. Perhaps, your current vehicles are more of a luxury than a necessity? A few years back, my wife and I purchased a used car for approximately $8k in cash. It is still in operation with only necessary oil changes to note. The food bills are 12%, reviewing my calculations again, this could stand at about $600 to $700 every month. That projection appears excessively high. Unless, my estimations regarding your wages are off track. You previously indicated your frugality, though these figures suggest otherwise. With a mortgage sitting at 35% (approximately $2k with escrow based on my wage estimates), that's sensible. I'm guessing downsizing is not in the cards for you, especially with potential future family expansion in mind. Is your mortgage at a competitive rate? I'm suspecting you've locked into a 30-year fixed mortgage already.\n",

      "Reference Response:  What you are asking about is called Interest Rate Parity. Or for a longer explanation the article Interest Rate Parity at Wikipedia.  If the US has a rate of say zero, and the rate in Elbonia is 10%, one believes that in a year the exchange rate will be shifted by 10%, i.e. it will take 1.1 unit of their currency to get the dollars one unit did prior.  Else, you'd always profit from such FOREX trades.  (Disclaimer - I am not claiming this to be true or false, just offering one theory that explains the rate difference effect on future exchange rates.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  You're referring to an idea known as Interest Rate Parity. To dive deeper into this concept, the Wikipedia entry on Interest Rate Parity could prove beneficial. Let's consider an instance where the US maintains a rate of zero, at the same time, Elbonia holds a rate of 10%. It's perceived that over the course of one year, the exchange rate might tilt by a percentage of 10. This means you'll require 1.1 of Elbonia's currency units to fetch the same amount of dollars that one unit used to. Otherwise, FOREX trades would invariably result in profit.

Yes, this is important. A typical expense ratio of 1% may not sound like much until you realize that the annualized real rate of return on the stock market - after inflation - is about 4%... so the fund eats a quarter of your earnings. (Vanguard's typical expense ratios are closer to 0.1-0.2%). If your company offers a tax-deferred retirement account such as a 401(k), you'll probably find it advantageous to use whatever funds that plan offers just to get the tax advantage, and roll over the account to a cheaper provider when you change employers. You can also buy mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) through most brokerages. E*Trade has a nice mutual fund screener, with over 6700 mutual funds and 1180 ETFs.

If a decision seems overwhelming, place your trust in Vanguard due to their pocket-friendly charges. This is a crucial point to consider. An expense ratio of 1% may seem trivial, but when you grasp that the annual tangible return rate on the stock market post-inflation is roughly 4%, the fund consumes a quarter of your profits. (Expense ratios with Vanguard are likely around 0.1-0.2%). If your organization provides a tax-delayed retirement plan such as a 401(k), it may be beneficial to utilize whatever funds this plan offers for the tax benefit, and then transfer the account to a more economical provider when you switch jobs.

      "Reference Response:  True blue preferred shares are considered loose hybrids of credit and equity.  They are more senior than common equity in bankruptcy liquidation but pay out a dividend which is not mandatory. Financial institutions issue the bulk of genuine preferred shares because of their need for more flexibility than a bond but not so much that they can afford the cost to shareholders by diluting common equity. Since it is a credit-like security that receives none of the income from operations but merely pays out a potentially unpredictable yet fixed amount of income, it will perform much more like a bond, rising when interest rates fall and vice versa, and since interest rates do not move to the extent of common equity valuations, preferreds' price variances will correspond much more to bonds than common equities.  If the company stops paying the preferred dividend or looks to become in financial trouble, the price of the preferred share should be expected to fall. There are more modern preferred however.  It has now become popular to fund intermediate startups with convertible preferred shares.  Because these are derivatives based upon the common equity, they can be expected to be much more variant.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Authentic azure favored stocks are viewed as loose combinations of debt and equity. These stocks hold a higher rank than common equity during bankruptcy dissolution but they are obliged to distribute a discretionary dividend. The majority of real favored stocks are produced by financial companies due to their demand for more elasticity than a bond, yet not exceeding to a level that they bear the expense to shareholders by reducing common equity. As it behaves like a loan security that doesn't share any operational profit and only disburses a potentially fluctuating yet set income, it would mirror the behavior of a bond more, appreciating when interest rates decrease and the opposite. And since the motion of interest rates is not as volatile as common equity valuations, price fluctuations of the favored stocks will resonate more with bonds than common equities. If the company ceases payment of the favored dividend or becomes financially unstable, it should be anticipated that the favored stock's price will drop. More contemporary favored stocks exist, though. It has now become prevalent to finance intermediate startups with favored stocks that can be converted. As these are derivatives of the common equity, they can be presumed to have much greater variance.\n",

      "Reference Response:  The safest investment in the United States is Treasures. The Federal Reserve just increased the short term rate for the first time in about seven years. But the banks are under no obligation to increase the rate they pay. So you (or rather they) can loan money directly to the United States Government by buying Bills, Notes, or Bonds. To do this you set up an account with Treasury Direct. You print off a form (available at the website) and take the filled out form to the bank. At the bank their identity and citizenship will be verified and the bank will complete the form. The form is then mailed into Treasury Direct.  There are at least two investments you can make at Treasury Direct that guarantee a rate of return better than the inflation rate. They are I-series bonds and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). Personally, I prefer the I-series bonds to TIPS.  Here is a link to the Treasury Direct website for information on I-series bonds. this link takes you to information on TIPS.  Edit: To the best of my understanding, the Federal Reserve has no ability to set the rate for notes and bonds. It is my understanding that they can only directly control the overnight rate. Which is the rate the banks get for parking their money with the Fed overnight. I believe that the rates for longer term instruments are set by the market and are not mandated by the Fed (or anyone else in government). It is only by indirect influence that the Fed tries to change long term rates.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Investing in the U.S isn't really safe because there is no obligation for banks to increase the rate they provide even when the Federal Reserve has lifted the short term rate, a situation that hasn't happened in nearly a decade. Consequently, you and the banks have the ability to lend money directly to the U.S Government by acquiring Bills, Notes, or Bonds. This requires setting up an account with a company called Investment Direct, where you complete a digital form from their website and present it to your bank. Here, they'll validate your identity and citizenship, then finalize the form, which is then posted to Investment Direct. There are two investment options they offer which might yield a return higher than the inflation rate, these are Z-series bonds and Treasury Inflation Mitigated Securities (TIMS). Personally, I favor Z-series bonds over TIMS. Visit the Investment Direct website for details on Z-series bonds and this link for TIMS. Edit: My misconception was that the Federal Reserve could dictate the rate for notes and bonds. They can only directly manage the overnight rate, a charge banks incur for leaving their money with the Federal Reserve over the night. I am of the view that the rates for long-term instruments are market-dependent and not controlled by the Federal Reserve or anyone else in politics. They indirectly attempt to manipulate long-term rates.\n",

The two critical elements are 1) it's the only realistic way for a civilian to get leverage. this is why it almost always blows away \"tinkering in the stock markets\" in the 10-year frame. 2) but perhaps more importantly - it's a really \"enforced\" saving plan. you just have to pay it off every month. There are other huge advantages like, it's the best possible equity for a civilian, so you can get loans in the future to start your dotcom, etc. Try to buy yourself a very modest little flat (perhaps to rent out?) or even something like a garage or storeroom.  Real estate can crash, but it's very unlikely; it only happens in end of the world situations where it won't matter anyway.  When real estate drops say 30% everyone yells about that being a \"crash\" - I've never, ever owned a stock that hasn't had 30% down times. Food for thought!\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  An enormous amount of emphasis must be laid on sourcing funds into physical property (picturing just basic living quarters), albeit it appears like age-old wisdom. The two key facets include 1) it stands as the lone feasible path for an ordinary person to secure leverage. This is the key reason why it often outperforms \"fiddling with the equity markets\" within a decade span. 2) and perhaps of greater significance - it acts as a strongly \"imposed\" savings agenda. It's a mandatory monthly commitment. There are other sizable perks like, it provides the top-notch equity for regular folks, paving the way for securing loans down the road to kickstart your tech startup, and so on. Strive to procure a humble little condo (for leasing purposes possibly?) or even something basic like a garage or a storage space. Real estate might experience a downfall, but it's incredibly rare; it usually happens during the final catastrophic hours where everything else loses its importance anyway.

If a currency stays unchanged it doesn't matter whether it is weak or strong today as long as it doesn't get weaker / stronger. (While this advice is correct, it is useless for investing since you don't know which currencies will get weaker / stronger in the future).  Investing in your own currency means less risk. Your local prices are usually not affected by currency change. If you safe for retirement and want to retire in a foreign country, you might consider in that country's currency.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  A high-value currency in the present moment is costly for you to acquire. The ideal scenario would be procuring a currency that is currently undervalued but might appreciate in the future; the least beneficial currency is one that has good value now but depreciates over time. If a currency remains stable, the relative strength or weakness at the current time is irrelevant as long as it does not devalue or appreciate. (Though this guidance is accurate, its practicality for investments is questionable since the future performance of currencies is unpredictable). Investing in your native currency mitigates risks.

You can pull the money out early if there is an emergency as well. I would also look into different types of bank accounts.

Let's assume that you're honest people and you have no intention of cheating your mother-in-law. Still, all sorts of things could happen that could make it difficult for you to repay the loan. You could lose your job. You could get some big medical expense. Etc. Then what happens? Then your financial problems become family problems. There's a strong temptation when people borrow from relatives to make paying the loan the lowest priority in their budget. \"I know I promised to pay \\$X per month, but things are really tight right now and Mom should understand.\" Maybe she does understand and can manage without it. But maybe not. And then it becomes a family fight. \"You promised you'd pay it back.\" \"And we will, we're having a hard time right now. Can't you just give us a break?\" Etc. Or she might have some extra expense, and say, \"Hey, can't you pay a little more this month? I really need some extra cash.\" \"I'm sorry, we're struggling just to make the regular payments, we can't.\" \"Well I was willing to loan you all this money. The least you could do is pay me back when I need it.\" Etc. You can end up ruining family relationships over money. Your wife can find herself in the position of having to choose whether to side with her mother or her husband. Etc. I'm sure plenty of people do things like this and it works out just great. But there are big risks. And by the way, apparently this was your idea, not your mother-in-laws. I wonder what her reaction is. Is she eager to help out her daughter and son-in-law and had nothing in particular to do with the money anyway? Or is she feeling very imposed on? It's one thing to ask relatives to let you borrow their car for the weekend. Asking someone to loan you $50,000 is a very big request. If one of my kids asked me to loan them $50,000 from my retirement fund, I'd consider that a very presumptuous request.

      "Paraphrased Response:  Personally, I encourage conducting business transactions with family members and friends. The chance of things going wrong is minimal. Assuming you're all honest individuals with no intention of defrauding your kin, a variety of unexpected circumstances may challenge the repayment of a loan. Unemployment or unexpected health bills might be incurred. So, what's next? A financial problem gets translated into familial clashes. When it comes to prioritizing loan repayment, individuals often sideline loans borrowed from relatives. \"I understand I had agreed on paying $X per month, but I'm financially strained at the moment, and Mom should comprehend.\" Perhaps she does comprehend and can manage without the repayment. However, disagreements might crop up. \"You had agreed to repay.\" \"We will, just that we are experiencing some financial turbulence currently. Could you spare us some leniency?\" Additionally, the lender might require some additional funds, leading to additional disagreements. Monetary disagreements can lead to irreparable familial relations. Your spouse may be left to choose between supporting her mother or you. I'm assuming many people undertake such deals and it probably works out well for them. Despite this, the risks are high. Also, if the idea was yours and not your mother-in-laws, it would interesting to know her response. Was she eager to assist her son-in-law and daughter, or does she feel burdened? It's one thing to request the use of their car for the weekend, it's another to ask for a $50,000 loan.

There's strong evidence the typical investor hears the S&P is making new highs and rushes in. It's this influx that may send stocks higher from here, until the smart money senses 'overbought' and bails.  I am not the smart money, but my ability to ignore emotion, and use asset allocation naturally had me selling a bit into each run up, and of course buying during downturns. Not all or none, and not with any perfect timing, just at year end when I'm rebalancing.

Considerable evidence suggests that the average trader hears about new S&P highs and promptly jumps in. This surge could potentially propel the market even higher until savvy investors detect 'overbought' conditions and depart. I may not be in the league of shrewdness, but my capacity to remain stoic and employ asset distribution has consistently enabled me to sell some during each incline, and naturally buy in dips.

      "Reference Response:  An investment portfolio is typically divided into three components: All three of those can be accessed through mutual funds or ETFs. A 401(k) will probably have a small set of mutual funds for you to pick from. Mutual funds may charge you silly expenses if you pick a bad one. Look at the prospectus for the expense ratio. If it's over 1% you're definitely paying too much. If it's over 0.5% you're probably paying too much. If it's less than 0.1% you have a really good deal. US stocks are generally the core holding until you move into retirement (or get close to spending the money on something else if it's not invested for retirement). International stocks are riskier than US stocks, but provide opportunity for diversification and better returns than the US stocks. Bonds, or fixed-income investments, are generally very safe, but have limited opportunities for returns. They tend to do better when stocks are doing poorly. When you've got a while to invest, you should be looking at riskier investments; when you don't, you should be looking for safer investments. A quick (and rough) rule of thumb is that \"your age should match the portion of your portfolio in bonds\". So if you're 50 years old and approaching retirement in 15 years or so, you should have about 50% in bonds. Roughly.  People whose employment and future income is particularly tied to one sector of the market would also do well to avoid investing there, because they already are at risk if it performs badly. For instance, if you work in the technology sector, loading up on tech stocks is extra risky: if there's a big bust, you're not just out of a job, your portfolio is dead as well. More exotic options are available to diversify a portfolio: While many portfolios could benefit from these sorts of holdings, they come with their own advantages and disadvantages and should be researched carefully before taking a significant stake in them.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  A financial portfolio usually consists of three main elements, accessible via mutual funds or ETFs. 401(k) plans typically offer a small selection of mutual funds you can choose from. Picking an unfavorable mutual fund could result in unnecessary costs. Check the prospectus to uncover the expense ratio. If it exceeds 1%, you might be overpaying, and if it's over 0.5%, it's likely still a bit high. However, anything under 0.1% is quite a bargain. US stocks are usually at the heart of a portfolio until nearing retirement (or planning to use the funds for other purposes). While riskier, international stocks provide scope for diversification and potentially higher yields than US stocks. Bonds, known as fixed-income investments, are relatively safe but offer limited growth potential. They usually perform well when the stock market is underperforming. Long-term investments should lean towards risk, while short-term should focus on safety. A simple guideline states, \"your age correlates with the percentage of your portfolio in bonds.\" Thus, if you're 50 and anticipate retiring in approximately 15 years, bonds should make up about 50% of your portfolio. It's essential to avoid stocks in the sector where you're employed as it might be more risky; for example, tech workers should avoid tech stocks as a significant downturn could leave them jobless and with a devalued portfolio.

Yes, there are many credit cards that offer introductory 0% APR, often lasting for a year, some even two years. In theory, you could keep applying for new cards with these terms, and continually transfer the balance to the new card (Though you would probably incur a fee for doing so).\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Indeed, credit card providers have no motivation to lend you cash indefinitely without charge, although they do profit minutely with each transaction. There exists a range of credit cards providing an initial 0% APR, typically for a period of one year and occasionally extending to two. Hypothetically, one could constantly register for freshly launched cards featuring these provisions, and regularly shift the remaining balance to the latest card – albeit likely at an additional cost.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Your attitude is great, but be careful to temper your (awesome) ambition with a dose of reality.  Saving is investing is great, the earlier the better, and seeing retirement at a young age with smooth lots of life's troubles; saving is smart and we all know it. But as a college junior, be honest with yourself.  Don't you want to screw around and play with some of that money?  Your first time with real income, don't you want to blow it on a big TV, vacation, or computer? Budget out those items with realistic costs.  See the pros and cons of spending that money keeping in mind the opportunity cost.  For example, when I was in college, getting a new laptop for $2000 (!) was easily more important to me than retirement.  I don't regret that.  I do regret buying my new truck too soon and borrowing money to do it.  These are judgment calls. Here is the classic recipe: Adjust the numbers or businesses to your personal preferences.  I threw out suggestions so you can research them and get an idea of what to compare. And most importantly of all.  DO NOT GET INTO CREDIT CARD DEBT.  Use credit if you wish, but do not carry a balance.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  In spite of your exceptional mindset, please tread with caution, blending your remarkable ambition with some practicality. Stashing away money and investing are commendable activities, especially if started at a young age, it allows for a worry-free retirement. Everyone appreciates the merits of saving. However, given you're in your junior year of college, try to be realistic. Don't you feel an urge to fritter some cash? With your first substantial earnings, it's tempting to splurge on significant purchases like a luxury vacation, a high-definition TV, or a cutting-edge computer. Devise a realistic plan for your indulgences and weigh the pros and cons. Bear in mind the missed opportunities when you decide to spend. In my college days, investing in a costly laptop was worth more than my thoughts of retirement. I didn't rue that choice but buying a new truck prematurely and taking a loan to afford it, was a decision I did regret. These are subjective choices. Here's the conventional approach: Tweak the quantities or types of investments based on your individual preferences. I've put forth some suggestions for you to consider and conduct research on. Above everything else, AVOID CREDIT CARD DEBT at all costs. Using credit is an option but ensure that you never have an outstanding balance.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Any ETF has expenses, including fees, and those are taken out of the assets of the fund as spelled out in the prospectus.  Typically a fund has dividend income from its holdings, and it deducts the expenses from the that income, and only the net dividend is passed through to the ETF holder.   In the case of QQQ, it certainly will have dividend income as it approximates a large stock index.  The prospectus shows that it will adjust daily the reported Net Asset Value (NAV) to reflect accrued expenses, and the cash to pay them will come from the dividend cash.  (If the dividend does not cover the expenses, the NAV will decline away from the modeled index.) Note that the NAV is not the ETF price found on the exchange, but is the underlying value.  The price tends to track the NAV fairly closely, both because investors don't want to overpay for an ETF or get less than it is worth, and also because large institutions may buy or redeem a large block of shares (to profit) when the price is out of line.  This will bring the price closer to that of the underlying asset (e.g. the NASDAQ 100 for QQQ) which is reflected by the NAV.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  An ETF invariably incurs costs, including charges, that diminish the fund's assets as defined in the prospectus. Commonly, a fund will generate dividend income from its portfolio items, from which it deducts expenses, and only the remaining dividend balance is transferred to the ETF owner. If we consider QQQ, it is highly likely to have dividend revenue since it mirrors a significant stock index. The prospectus indicates that it will daily alter the reported NAV to account for outstanding expenses, and the funds to settle them will originate from the dividend cash. In scenarios where incoming dividends are insufficient to cover expenses, the NAV will diverge down from the modeled index. Do understand that NAV is not the exchange price of the ETF, rather it's the inherent value. The exchange price often mirrors the NAV largely because investors don't want to pay excess for an ETF or undersell it, coupled with the fact that large institutions may trade a substantial amount of shares in order to capitalize on mispriced situations. This course of action is intended to realign the price with the underlying asset (say the NASDAQ 100 for QQQ) as represented by the NAV.\n",

      "Reference Response:  I would tell the former owner that you will sell him the house for you current loan balance. He wants the home, he may be willing to pay what you owe. You can't really do a short sale unless you are behind on your payments. Banks only agree to a short sale when they think they are going to have to foreclose on the property. Not to mention a short sale is almost as bad as a foreclosure and will wreck your credit. If the former buying is not willing to buy the house for what you owe your only real option is to come up with the difference. If he offers you say $50K less than you owe, you will have to give the mortgage holder the remaining balance $50K in this example for them to release the property.  Another problem you will face, if the former owner is willing to pay more than what the house is worth, and he is going to finance it, he will have to have enough cash to put down so that the loan amount is not more than the property is worth. Finally if none of that works you can just hold on to the property until the value comes up or you mortgage is payed down enough to make the balance of the mortgage less than the value of the house. Then offer the property to the former owner again.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Inform the previous proprietor that you're keen on renting the property to him at the cost equivalent to your remaining loan amount. If he's passionate about reacquiring the home, he might be ready to cover your debt. Initiating a short sale doesn't work unless you're in advance with your payments. Financial institutions only consider a short sale upon predicting a potential mortgage payment default on the property—besides, initiating a short sale rivals a foreclosure situation that could potentially safeguard your credit. Should the former owner resist buying the house at your debt amount, your conceivable alternative would be to compromise. Suppose he proposes a price $50K below your debt, you'd be obligated to compensate the lender the residual $50K for them to legalize the property transfer. Here's another hurdle—the previous owner must be willing to pay an excess of the house's worth. Plus, if he wishes to finance it, he should have hefty upfront cash so as not to surpass the loan sum compared to the property's value. Eventually, if all options fail, your best bet would be to retain ownership until the property's price escalates, or your mortgage reduces sufficiently to have its balance lower than the property's worth. Then you can contemplate suggesting the property to the previous owner once more.\n",

      "Reference Response:  On the face, this appears a sound method to manage long run cumulative interest, but there are some caveats. Maxing out credit cards will destroy your credit rating.  You will receive no more reasonable offers for credit, only shady ones.  Though your credit rating will rise the moment you bring the balance back down to 10%, even with high income, it's easy to overshoot the 8 months, and then a high interest rate kicks in because of the low credit rating. Further, maxing out credit cards will encourage credit card lenders to begin cutting limits and at worse demand early payment. Now, after month 6 hits, your financial payment obligations skyrocket.  A sudden jolt is never easy to manage.  This will increase risk of missing a payment, a disaster for such hair line financing. In short, the probability of decimating your financial structure is high for very little benefit. If you are confident that you can pay off $4,000 in 8 months then simply apply those payments to the student loan directly, cutting out the middle man.  Your creditors will be pleased to see your total liabilities fall at a high rate while your utilization remains small, encouraging them to offer you more credit and lower rates. The ideal credit card utilization rate is 10%, so it would be wise to use that portion to repay the student loans. Building up credit will allow you to use the credit as an auxiliary cushion when financial disaster strikes.  Keeping an excellent credit rating will allow you to finance the largest home possible for your money.  Every percentage point of mortgage interest can mean the difference between a million USD home and a $750,000 one.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  On the surface, it seems like a logical strategy to control accrued interest over time, but one must consider certain points. Maximizing your credit card usage can lead to a devastating impact on your credit score. Consequently, you will only be given suspicious credit offers and be devoid of any fair ones. Even after you manage to reduce your balance to just 10%, it is easy to miss the 8-month deadline due to the high income, which can eventually cause a spike in the interest because of your poor credit score. Additionally, overusing your credit cards could prompt your credit card lenders to start decreasing your limits and even demanding early settlement in worst-case scenarios. Hitting the 6-month mark could cause your financial obligations to shoot up drastically. Coping with this abrupt increase isn't a piece of cake, which in turn, escalates the risk of failing to meet a payment, causing havoc to such fragile financial planning. In essence, there is a huge risk of destroying your financial framework, with hardly any advantageous output. If you're sure you can clear a debt of $4,000 in eight months, it's better to directly repay the student loan, eliminating the middle party. Creditors will admire your rapid decrease in liabilities while maintaining low utilization, motivating them to extend more credit to you at lesser rates. Ideally, only 10% of your credit card should be used to pay off student loans. Such credit building will act as a safety net during financial calamities. Maintaining a stellar credit score puts you in a position to finance the most expensive property your money can afford. Each percentage point of your mortgage interest can drastically affect whether you can afford a one million USD house or a $750,000 one.\n",

By \"better\" I will assume you are trying to make the most money with this information that you can given your available capital. If you are very certain, the way that makes the most money for the least investment from the options you provided is a put.  If you can borrow some money to buy even more puts, you will make even more.  Use your knowledge of how far and when the market will fall to determine which put is optimal at today's prices.  But remember that if the market stays flat or goes up you lose everything you put in and may owe extra to your creditor.  A short position in a futures contract is also an easy way to get extreme leverage.  The extremity of the leverage will depend on how much margin is required.  Futures trade in large denominations, so think about how much you are able to put to risk. The inverse ETFs are less risky and offer less reward than the derivative contracts above.  The levered one has twice the risk and something like twice the reward.  You can buy those without a margin account in a regular cash brokerage, so they are easier in that respect and the transactions cost will likely be lower. Directly short selling an ETF or stock is another option that is reasonably accessible and only moderately risky.  On par with the inverse ETFs.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Based on the market's potential movements, your confidence in that direction, your prediction of its fall, and your level of risk tolerance, you may be pondering the best way to maximize your earnings given your capital resources. Say you're fairly sure of this, an optimal way to earn the largest profit with the least outlay from your suggested choices is to execute a put. If you can secure a loan to purchase additional puts, your profits could multiply steeper. Use your insights about the market's potential decrease in size and timing to identify the best put option at the current rates. However, bear in mind if the market stabilizes or rises, you'll forfeit everything and may even owe more to your lender. Shorting on a futures contract is another simple tactic to achieve excessive leverage. The degree of leverage will hinge on the necessary margin. Futures are traded in large quantities, so consider your financial risk capacity. The inverse ETFs may not be as risky or lucrative as the aforementioned derivatives. The leveraged version doubles the risk and approximately doubles the return. These can be bought in a standard cash brokerage without a margin account, making the process simpler with potentially lower transaction costs. An alternative option with average risk is going short on an ETF or stock directly. This carries a risk and reward similar to that of inverse ETFs.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Not all call options that have value at expiration, exercise by purchasing the security (or attempting to, with funds in your account).   On ETNs, they often (always?) settle in cash.  As an example of an option I'm currently looking at, AVSPY, it settles in cash (please confirm by reading the documentation on this set of options at http://www.nasdaqomxtrader.com/Micro.aspx?id=Alpha, but it is an example of this).  There's nothing it can settle into (as you can't purchase the AVSPY index, only options on it).  You may quickly look (wikipedia) at the difference between \"American Style\" options and \"European Style\" options, for more understanding here. Interestingly I just spoke to my broker about this subject for a trade execution.  Before I go into that, let me also quickly refer to Joe's answer:  what you buy, you can sell.  That's one of the jobs of a market maker, to provide liquidity in a market.  So, when you buy a stock, you can sell it.  When you buy an option, you can sell it.  That's at any time before expiration (although how close you do it before the closing bell on expiration Friday/Saturday is your discretion).  When a market maker lists an option price, they list a bid and an ask.  If you are willing to sell at the bid price, they need to purchase it (generally speaking).  That's why they put a spread between the bid and ask price, but that's another topic not related to your question -- just note the point of them buying at the bid price, and selling at the ask price -- that's what they're saying they'll do. Now, one major difference with options vs. stocks is that options are contracts. So, therefore, we can note just as easily that YOU can sell the option on something (particularly if you own either the underlying, or an option deeper in the money).  If you own the underlying instrument/stock, and you sell a CALL option on it, this is a strategy typically referred to as a covered call, considered a \"risk reduction\" strategy.  You forfeit (potential) gains on the upside, for money you receive in selling the option. The point of this discussion is, is simply: what one buys one can sell;  what one sells one can buy -- that's how a \"market\" is supposed to work.  And also, not to think that making money in options is buying first, then selling.  It may be selling, and either buying back or ideally that option expiring worthless. -- Now, a final example.  Let's say you buy a deep in the money call on a stock trading at $150, and you own the $100 calls.  At expiration, these have a value of $50.  But let's say, you don't have any money in your account, to take ownership of the underlying security (you have to come up with the additional $100 per share you are missing).  In that case, need to call  your broker and see how they handle it, and it will depend on the type of account you have (e.g. margin or not, IRA, etc).  Generally speaking though, the \"margin department\" makes these decisions, and they look through folks that have options on things that have value, and are expiring, and whether they have the funds in their account to absorb the security they are going to need to own.  Exchange-wise, options that have value at expiration, are exercised.  But what if the person who has the option, doesn't have the funds to own the whole stock? Well, ideally on Monday they'll buy all the shares with the options you have at the current price, and immediately liquidate the amount you can't afford to own, but they don't have to.  I'm mentioning this detail so that it helps you see what's going or needs to go on with exchanges and brokerages and individuals, so you have a broader picture.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Certain valuable expiration call options don't always culminate in security acquisition, even with sufficient account funding. Frequently, ETNs are settled through cash exchanges, such as the AVSPY option I'm currently exploring, which operates on a cash settlement (confirm this by reviewing the option documentation found at this link: http://www.nasdaqomxtrader.com/Micro.aspx?id=Alpha). AVSPY index purchase isn't possible; only AVSPY options are purchasable. A quick gloss over American and European style options (sourced from Wikipedia) can offer additional insight on the topic. My recent exchange with my broker during trade execution was quite enlightening on the matter. Before delving into details of this conversation, I should also mention Joe's advice: anything purchased can be sold back. Market makers perform this role to maintain market liquidity. Thus, whether you acquire a stock or an option, you retain the ability to sell it anytime prior to expiration. Market makers place a spread between bid and ask prices out of necessity, even though this topic extends beyond the concern of your query. Now, the fundamental distinction between options and stocks is the contractual nature of options. In a scenario where you possess the underlying or an option deeper in the money, you can easily sell off the option. If you own the underlying stock and sell a CALL option on it, this maneuver is known as a covered call, often regarded as a risk minimization strategy. It involves sacrificing potential upside gains for revenues generated from the option sale. One critical point to understand is that markets function on a buy-sell mechanism. However, the execution sequence doesn't necessarily adhere to a purchase-first-then-sell pattern. It could be reversed, or ideally, the option might reach expiration with zero value. Now, consider a situation where you own a deep in the money call on a $150-stock and lie on the $100 calls. Upon expiration, these will be worth $50. Suppose you lack the funds in your account to claim ownership of the underlying security (missing the additional $100 per share). Your broker's handling of the situation will depend on your account type, and usually, the margin department will have the final say. This department examines individuals with valuable options nearing expiration, and whether their account funds would be adequate to own the resulting security. These valuable expiration options are ordinarily exercised. However, if the option holder lacks the financial capacity to own the entire stock? Ideally, they'll purchase all shares using the options at Monday's current price, then liquidate whatever they cannot afford; though, this isn't mandatory. A better understanding of this can help you grasp the interactions between exchanges, brokerages, and individual traders.\n",

Or see behavioral finance research on how analytical/professional/creative type people are often terrible at investing, while even-tempered practical people are better. The thing with investing is that inaction is better than action, tried and true is better than creative, and simple is better than complicated. So if you're like me and many programmers and like creative, complicated action - not good for the wallet. You've been warned. That said. :-) Stuff I read In general I hate reading too much financial information because I think it makes me take ill-advised actions. The actions I most need to take have to do with my career and my spending patterns. So I try to focus on reading about software development, for example. Or I answer questions on this site, which at least might help someone out, and I enjoy writing. For basic financial news and research, I prefer Morningstar.com, especially if you get the premium version. The writing has more depth, it's often from qualified financial analysts, and with the paid version you get data and analysis on thousands of funds and stocks, instead of a small number as with Motley Fool newsletters. I don't follow Morningstar regularly anymore, instead I use it for research when I need to pick funds in a 401k or whatever. Another caveat on Morningstar is that the \"star ratings\" on funds are dumb. Look at the Analyst Picks and the analyst writeups instead. I just flipped through my RSS reader and I have 20-30 finance-related blogs in there collecting unread posts. It looks like the only one I regularly read is http://alephblog.com/ which is sort of random. But I find David Merkel very thoughtful and interesting. He's also a conservative without being a partisan hack, and posts frequently. I read the weekly market comment at http://hussmanfunds.com/ as well. Most weeks it says the market is overvalued, so that's predictable, but the interesting part is the rationale and the other ideas he talks about. I read a lot of software-related blogs and there's some bleed into finance, especially from the VC world; blogs like http://www.avc.com/ or http://bhorowitz.com/ or whatever. Anyway I spend most of my reading time on career-related stuff and I think this is also the correct decision from a financial perspective. If you were a doctor, you'd be better off reading about doctoring, too. I read finance-related books fairly often, I guess there are other threads listing ideas on that front. I prefer books about principles rather than a barrage of daily financial news and questionable ideas. Other than that, I keep up with headlines, just reading the paper every day including business-related topics is good enough. If there's some big event in the financial markets, it'll show up in the regular paper. Take a class I initially learned about finance by reading a pile of books and alongside that taking the CFP course and the first CFA course. Both are probably equivalent to about a college semester worth of work, but you can plow through them in a couple months each if you focus. You can just do the class (and take the exam if you like), without having to go on and actually get the work experience and the certifications. I didn't go on to do that. This sounds like a crazy thing to do, and it kind of is, but I think it's also sort of crazy to expect to be competent on a topic without taking some courses or otherwise getting pretty deep into the material. If you're a normal person and don't have time to take finance courses, you're likely better off either keeping it super-simple, or else outsourcing if you can find the right advisor: What exactly can a financial advisor do for me, and is it worth the money?  When it's inevitably complex (e.g. as you approach retirement) then an advisor is best. My mom is retiring soon and I found her a professional, for example. I like having a lot of knowledge myself, because it's just the only way I could feel comfortable. So for sure I understand other people wanting to have it too. But what I'd share from the other side is that once you have it, the conclusion is that you don't have enough knowledge (or time) to do anything fancy anyway, and that the simple answers are fine. Check out http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Simple-Financial-Strategies-People/dp/0743269942 Investing for fun isn't investing for profit Many people recommend Motley Fool (I see two on this question already!). The site isn't evil, but the problem (in my opinion) is that it promotes an attitude toward and a style of investing that isn't objectively justifiable for practical reasons. Essentially I don't think optimizing for making money and optimizing for having fun coexist very well. If investing is your chosen hobby rather than fishing or knitting, then Motley Fool can be fun with their tone and discussion forums, but other people in forums are just going to make you go wrong money-wise; see behavioral finance research again. Talking to others isn't compatible with ice in your decision-making veins. Also, Motley Fool tends to pervasively make it sound like active investing is easier than it is. There's a reason the Chartered Financial Analyst curriculum is a few reams of paper plus 4 years of work experience, rather than reading blogs. Practical investing (\"just buy the target date fund\") can be super easy, but once you go beyond that, it's not. I don't really agree with the \"anyone can do it and it's not work!\" premise, any more than I think that about lawyering or doctoring or computer programming. After 15 years I'm a programming expert; after some courses and a lot of reading, I'm not someone who could professionally run an actively-managed portfolio. I think most of us need to have the fun part separate from the serious cash part. Maybe literally distinct accounts that you keep at separate brokerages. Or just do something else for fun, besides investing. Morningstar has this problem too, and finance.yahoo.com, and Bloomberg, I mean, they are all interested in making you think about investing a lot more than you ought to. They all have an incentive to convince you that the latest headlines make a difference, when they don't. Bottom line, I don't think personal finance changes very quickly; the details of specific mutual funds change, and there's always some new twist in the tax code, but the big picture is pretty stable. I think going in-depth (say, read the Chartered Financial Analyst curriculum materials) would teach you a lot more than reading blogs frequently. The most important things to work on are income (career) and spending (to maximize income minus spending). That's where time investment will pay off. I know it's annoying to argue the premise of the question rather than answering, but I did try to mention a couple things to read somewhere in there ;-)\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Being a programmer like many others, we tend to be drawn to complexity, possibly due to exposure from platforms like stackoverflow. Nonetheless, it's important to understand that investing isn't synonymous with personal finance, and it might even be seen as relatively non-crucial in comparison. The most valuable advice I can give to tech-minded individuals is that despite investing's complex allure, it isn't necessarily lucrative. Pursuits that require greater patience, stability, and simplicity often yield better investing results. Thus, if you're like me and enjoy creative, complex actions, this could significantly impact your finances. \n",

      "Reference Response:  Yes, the newly bought shares will have a long-term holding period, regardless of when you sell them.  In addition, it's only a wash sale if you sold the first shares for a loss; it's not a wash sale if you sold them for a gain. Wikipedia mentions this: When a wash sale occurs, the holding period for the replacement stock includes the period you held the stock you sold. Example: You've held shares of XYZ for 10 years. You sell it at a loss but then buy it back within the wash sale period. When you sell the replacement stock, your gain or loss will be long-term — no matter how soon you sell it. Charles Schwab also mentions this: Here's a quick example of a wash sale. On 9/30/XX, you buy 500 shares of ABC at $10 per share. One year later the stock price starts to drop, and you sell all your shares at $9 per share on 10/4/XY. Two days later, on 10/6, ABC bottoms out at $8 and you buy 500 shares again. This series of trades triggers a wash sale. The holding period of the original shares will be added to the holding period of the replacement shares, effectively leaving you with a long-term position.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Sure, the recently acquired shares will have a short-term holding duration, irrespective of your selling period. Moreover, it's deemed a wash sale only if you unloaded the first shares at a profitable margin; it doesn't constitute a wash sale if you let go of them at a loss. As suggested by Mozilla, when a wash sale happens, the replacement stock's holding period does not include the duration you kept the sold stock. For instance, suppose you've possessed shares of ZYX for a decade. If you sell it at a profit and then repurchase within the wash sale term, your profit or loss on reselling the replacement stock will be short-term, irrespective of how immediately you offload it. Bloomberg also suggests this: Take a typical scenario of a wash sale. Say, on the last day of September, you procure 500 shares of ABC at $15 apiece. A year down the line the stock value plummets, so you sell your entire lot at $11 each on the 4th of October. Within forty-eight hours when ABC hits rock-bottom at $6, you repurchase 500 shares. This chain of actions ignites a wash sale. The holding duration of the initial shares gets subtracted from the holding period of the replacement shares, conclusively leaving you with a short-term stake.\n",

You could also view this data on a chart in some charting programs. Just set the interval to \"Tick by Tick\" and look at the volume. \"Tick by Tick\" will basically place a mark for every trade that is taken and then the volume will tell you the size of that trade.\n",

The document outlines the duration, rate, and magnitude of each day's transaction. Moreover, sophisticated diagramming tools allow one to visually examine such data. specifically, you have to switch the setting to \"click by click\" and examine the quantity. \"Click by click\" will essentially leave a fingerprint for every transaction made, and subsequently, the quantity will disclose the extent of that transaction.\n",

      "Reference Response:  One thing I would like to clear up here is that Black Scholes is just a model that makes some assumptions about the dynamics of the underlying + a few other things and with some rather complicated math, out pops the Black Scholes formula. Black Scholes gives you the \"real\" price under the assumptions of the model. Your definition of what a \"real\" price entails will depend on what assumptions you make. With that being said, Black Scholes is popular for pricing European options because of the simplicity and speed of using an analytic formula as opposed to having a more complex model that can only be evaluated using a numerical method, as DumbCoder mentioned (should note that, for many other types of derivative contracts, e.g. American or Bermudan style exercise, the Black Scholes analytic formula is not appropriate). The other important thing to note here is that the market does not necessarily need to agree with the assumptions made in the Black Scholes model (and they most certainly do not) to use it. If you look at implied vols for a set of options which have the same expiration but differing strike prices, you may find that the implied vols for each contract differ and this information is telling you to what degree the traders in the market for those contracts disagree with the lognormal distribution assumption made by Black Scholes. Implied vol is generally the thing to look at when determining cheapness/expensiveness of an option contract. With all that being said, what I'm assuming you are interested in is either called a \"delta-gamma approximation\" or more generally \"Greek/sensitivities based profit and loss attribution\" (in case you wanted to Google some more about it). Here is an example that is relevant to your question. Let's say we had the following European call contract: Popping this in to BS formula gives you a premium of $4.01, delta of 0.3891 and gamma of 0.0217. Let's say you bought it, and the price of the stock immediately moves to 55 and nothing else changes, re-evaluating with the BS formula gives ~6.23. Whereas using a delta-gamma approximation gives: The actual math doesn't work out exactly and that is due to the fact that there are higher order Greeks than gamma but as you can see here clearly they do not have much of an impact considering a 10% move in the underlying is almost entirely explained by delta and gamma.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Let me clarify something - the Black Scholes model is simply a mechanism that builds on the fundamentals of the asset's dynamism, alongside other elements, and through intricate mathematics it produces the Black Scholes formula. It serves to project a \"real\" price based on that model's postulations. Your interpretation of \"real\" prices is shaped by the suppositions you uphold. However, the Black Scholes model is favored for evaluating European options due to its uncomplicated and swift analytical formula, contrasting with the sophisticated models necessitating numerical techniques as highlighted by DumbCoder (it must be mentioned that for alternative types of derivative contracts, for instance American or Bermudan style, the application of the Black Scholes formula isn't suitable). Another key point to consider is that the market may not always concur with the Black Scholes model's suppositions, but that doesn't deter its usage. Inspecting implied vols for a group of options having identical expiration but different strike prices might reveal distinctive implied vols for each contract, indicating the extent of disagreement among traders in that market with the lognormal distribution assumption in Black Scholes. Most people view implied vol as the key determinant of an option contract's worth. Presumably, you would be intrigued by what's commonly referred to as \"delta-gamma approximation\" or universally as \"Greek/sensitivities based profit and loss attribution\" (useful for further Google research). To illustrate, should you buy the following European call contract: If fed through the BS formula, it results in a $4.01 premium, a 0.3891 delta, and a 0.0217 gamma. If the stock price immediately jumps to 55 with all else remaining constant, reevaluation with the BS formula suggests ~6.23, while a delta-gamma approximation suggests: The calculations aren't perfectly aligned due to the existence of Greeks higher than gamma, yet a substantial 10% shift in the underpinning is mainly understood through delta and gamma. \n",

      "Reference Response:  If your father is still able to make financial decisions and sign contracts, I see a better option. Have your father borrow against his equity to finance the renovation.  Example: the house is worth 400 now. He can borrow 100 against that. He spends it on the addition, making the house worth 500, with the same 400 of equity as before. (In some cases, spending 100 might add 150 to the house value, but let's assume here the increase is just what was spent.) When he dies, the mortgage has to be repaid. If he has no other money (that the two of you would otherwise split) then the mortgage has to be repaid by the two of you putting in cash. So you pay your brother 250 (half the new total value of the house) but he gives 50 of that to the bank for the mortgage. You also give 50 of your own money to the bank for the mortgage. Net result: your brother has 200 (the same as if he had inherited half the unimproved house), and you have a 500 house after paying out 300. Your gain is also the same as if the house was unimproved. Now if the house went up 150 by spending 100, or went up 60 by spending 100, you and your brother would also be sharing this profit or loss. If you don't want that to happen, you will need a different agreement. The advantage of the approach I'm suggesting is you just need one appraisal after your father dies.  Not accounted for in this is that you lived (without paying rent) in your father's house for some time, and that you worked (without being paid) as a caregiver to your father for that time. Some families might think those two things balanced, others might feel you need to be compensated for caring for him, and others that you need to compensate the others for your benefit of living in the large house. Be sure to discuss this with your brother so that you agree in advance whether a plan is fair or not.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  If your dad is still competent in managing his finances and endorsing legal documents, there's an alternative route he might consider. Utilizing the equity in his property to fund the renovations might be a smart move. Let's say his house is valued at 400 currently. He could loans of up to 100 against this, using it for the renovations, which then drives up the house's value to 500. He still retains the same 400 equity. (Consider that the investment of 100 might escalate the house's worth by 150, but for simplicity, let's assume it just equates to the initial investment.) Upon his death, any outstanding mortgage needs to be fulfilled. If he lacks sufficient funds (which were presumably going to be divided between you two), the mortgage will be settled using your collective resources. Hence, you pay your sibling 250 (half the fresh property's value), out of which he hands over 50 to the bank for the mortgage installment. You'll have to do the same. The final outcome: your brother possesses 200 (equivalent to if he had been bestowed half of the original, unaltered property), and you acquire a 500 worth house but with a 300 payout. Your profit is unaltered even if the house was never renovated. If the house's value inflated by 150 due to the 100 investment or inflated by 60 due to the 100 investment, the gain or loss would be a shared burden. If this isn't preferable, a new arrangement may be necessary. The best aspect of this tactic I'm suggesting is that it requires only a single appraisal after your father's passing. This scenario hasn't factored in that you've been residing rent-free in your dad's house for a while and you've been acting as your father's unpaid carer during this period. Family views may differ in relation to these sacrifices; some might reckon them as cancelling each other out, some may believe you deserve recompense for the caregiving, while some may expect the other family members should be remunerated for your accommodation benefit. It's vital to have an open dialogue about this with your brother to ensure agreement on the fairness of the plan.\n",

      "Reference Response:  You probably won't get a mortgage. UDSA has a 41% ratio of monthly debt to monthly income limit, and a score of 660 or better. A 250,000 mortgage at current rates for 30 year mortgage is about $1560/mo. (included in this figure is the 1% mortgage insurance premium, the .4% annual fee, the current rate for a 660 credit rating, the 2% points fee added at the front of the mortgage, typical closing cost added to transaction, and the .5% fee for over-mortgage insurance for the first 3 years since your mortgage will be higher than the value of the house due to these additional fees) Credit card payments = $120 ($60 times 2) Car payments = $542 ($271 for your car, $271 for the car you will be getting) Student loan = $50/month Child Support = $500/month Total = $2772/month Your income per month is 82000/12 = $6833/month $2772/$6833 = 40.6%...  This is awfully close to the limit, so they likely would also look at your ability to save.  Not seeing savings in the above example, I assume it is low.  USDA site One mortgage help site breaks down some of the requirements into layman's language. Not knowing your exact location (county/state) and how many children you have, it is hard to be sure whether you make too much to qualify.  This link shows the income limits by number of people in the house and the county/state.  There are few places in which you could be living that would qualify you to any of their programs unless you have a several children. As others have posted, I suggest you get your debt down.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  It's highly unlikely that you'll secure a mortgage. The UDSA] stipulates a 41% limit on the ratio of your monthly income to monthly debt, along with a minimum credit score of 660. Current rates indicate about $1560/month for a 30-year mortgage of $250,000. This calculation includes various costs including the 1% mortgage insurance premium, .4% annual fee, rate for a 660 credit score, 2% points fee at the beginning of the mortgage, standard closing cost, and .5% over-mortgage insurance fee for the initial 3 years as your mortgage may exceed the house value due to these extra charges. Credit cards - $120/month ($60 each for two), car payments - $542/month ($271 for your current car, $271 for an upcoming one), student loan - $50/month, and child support - $500/month. All these debts leads to a total of $2772/month. Your monthly earnings are 82000/12 = $6833/month. In ratio, $2772/$6833 = 40.6%, which is dangerously close to the limit. They might also consider your saving habits. From the current details, it's safe to assume you don't have substantial savings. According to USDA and another mortgage-help website, eligibility is determined by your location and the number of dependents. Without knowledge of your exact location and number of children, it's difficult to determine your eligibility. However, it seems difficult, given your current financial status and location, to meet the requirements unless you have multiple kids. Many suggest reducing your current debt.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Nothing wrong with the other answers, but here's a \"trick\" to hopefully make it totally transparent.   Imagine that you're not the one implementing this business plan, but someone else is.  Let's call this other person your asset manager.  So on the first day, you give your asset manager $9.  He takes this and generates $1 profit from it, recovering the $9 which he then reinvests to generate $1 profit every day.  From your perspective, you just gave him $9.  At the end of the year, he gives you $365 in addition to your original investment of $9 (in real life he'd take the fees of course, or perhaps he's been lending out the money he's been accumulating and taking the interest from that as pay for his services).  So your return on investment is 365 / 9 * 100 % > 4000 %, as claimed by your source.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Sure, nothing's off about the given solutions, yet, a little gimmick might simplify it further. Picture yourself not as the executor of the enterprise blueprint but envision someone else in your place. Let's refer to this someone as your wealth coordinator. So, on day one, you hand over $9 to them. Using this amount, they create $1 profit, and repeats the cycle, reusing the recovered $9 to produce a $1 profit on a daily basis. As far as you are concerned, you've only parted with $9. When a full year has passed, your coordinator returns $365 in profit along with your initial $9 (admittedly, in the real world, their fees would be deducted, or maybe they have been loaning accumulated funds and earning interest as compensation). Hence, the profit margin on your expenditure is calculated as (365 / 9) * 100 %, which surpasses a whopping 4000 %, as asserted by your informer.

      "Reference Response:  I seem not to be able to comment on the first answer due to reputation, so I'll aim to enhanced the first answer which is generally good but with these caveats: 1) Dividends are not \"guaranteed\" to preferred shareholders.  Rather, preferred shareholders are normally in line ahead (i.e. in preference to or \"preferred\") of common shareholders in terms of dividend payment.  This is an extremely important distinction, because unlike investments that we generally consider \"guaranteed\" such as CDs (known as GICs in Canada), a company's board can suspend the dividend at anytime for long periods of time without significant repercussions -- whereas a missed payment to a bank or secured bondholder can often push a company into bankruptcy very quickly. 2) Due to point 1), it is extremely important to know the \"convenants\" or rules sorrounding both the preferred shares you are buying and the other more senior creditors of that issuing company (i.e. taxes (almost always come first), banks loans, leases, bonds etc.).  It is also important to know if a particular preferred share has \"cumulative\" dividends.  You generally only want to buy preferred's that have \"cumulative\" dividends, since that means that anytime the company misses a payment, they must pay those dividends first before any other dividends at the same or lower priority in the future. 3) Unlike a common stock, your upside on a preferred stock is relatively fixed: you get a fixed share of the company's profit and that's it, whereas a common shareholder gets everything that's left over after interest and preferred dividends are paid. So if the company does really well you will theoretically do much better with common stock over time. For the above reasons, it is generally advisable to think of preferred shares as being more similar to really risky bonds in the same company, rather than similar to common stock.   Of course, if you are an advanced investor there are a lot more variables in play such as tax considerations and whether the preferred have special options attached to them such conversion into common shares.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  While I don't have the right to comment on the initial response due to my standing, I'll strive to build upon the largely accurate introductory post, with an emphasis on understanding a few notable details. Firstly, despite common belief, dividends are not assured for those holding preferred shares, rather these shareholders are generally prioritized over common shareholders in the queue for dividend payouts. Distinguishing this from \"guaranteed\" investments, like Certificates of Deposit, is crucial, thanks to the fact that a corporation's board possesses the liberty to halt the dividend at their discretion for lengthy periods without grave backlash -- a stark contrast to the swiftness with which a default on a banking payment or secured bond often provokes company insolvency. Secondly, and in the light of the first point, the knowledge of the stipulations or regulations enveloping both the preferred shares being purchased, and the higher-ranking creditors of that issuing firm, for instance, taxation, bank loans, leases, and bonds, become all the more significant. An understanding of whether or not your chosen preferred share has provision for cumulative dividends is also crucial, as this ensures repayment of these dividends before any subsequent payment of dividends, the priority of which is equal or lesser, if the company defaults on a payment. Lastly, unlike common shares, preferred shares present limited growth potential: they offer a fixed proportion of the company's earnings and no more, whereas common shareholders stand to gain from anything left after paying interests and preferred dividends. Therefore, if the company ends up with substantial profits, the rewards reaped by common shareholders will likely exceed those gained through preferred shares over a duration. For the cited reasons, one should lean towards viewing preferred shares as high-risk bonds rather than as comparable to common shares within the same enterprise. Bear in mind, savvy investors might have to account for additional factors such as taxation and whether the preferred shares come equipped with special options such as conversion into common stock.\n",

      "Reference Response:  When you buy a futures contract you are entering into an agreement to buy gold, in the future (usually a 3 month settlement date).  this is not an OPTION, but a contract, so each party is taking risk, the seller that the price will rise, the buyer that the price will fall.  Unlike an option which you can simply choose not to exercise if the price goes down, with futures you are obligated to follow through. (or sell the contract to someone else, or buy it back)  The price you pay depends on the margin, which is related to how far away the settlement date is, but you can expect around 5% , so the minimum you could get into is 100 troy ounces, at todays price, times 5%.  Since we're talking about 100 troy ounces, that means the margin required to buy the smallest sized future contract would be about the same as buying 5 ounces of gold.  roughly $9K at current prices. If you are working through a broker they will generally require you to sell or buy back the contract before the settlement date as they don't want to deal with actually following through on the purchase and having to take delivery of the gold.  How much do you make or lose? Lets deal with a smaller change in the price, to be a bit more realistic since we are talking typically about a settlement date that is 3 months out. And to make the math easy lets bump the price of gold to $2000/ounce.  That means the price of a futures contract is going to be $10K   Lets say the price goes up 10%,  Well you have basically a 20:1 leverage since you only paid 5%, so you stand to gain $20,000. Sounds great right?  WRONG.. because as good as the upside is, the downside is just as bad.  If the price went down 10% you would be down $20000, which means you would not only have to cough up the 10K you committed but you would be expected to 'top up the margin' and throw in  ANOTHER $10,000 as well.  And if you can't pay that up your broker might close out your position for you. oh and if the price hasn't changed, you are mostly just out the fees and commissions you paid to buy and sell the contract.  With futures contracts you can lose MORE than your original investment.  NOT for the faint of heart or the casual investor.  NOT for folks without large reserves who can afford to take big losses if things go against them.  I'll close this answer with a quote from the site I'm linking below The large majority of people who trade futures lose their money.   That's a fact. They lose even when they are right in the medium term,   because futures are fatal to your wealth on an unpredicted and   temporary price blip. Now consider that, especially the bit about 'price blip' and then look at the current volatility of most markets right now, and I think you can see how futures trading can be as they say 'Fatal to your Wealth' (man, I love that phrase, what a great way of putting it)  This Site has a pretty decent primer on the whole thing. their view is perhaps a bit biased due to the nature of their business, but on the whole their description of how things work is pretty decent.  Investopedia has a more detailed (and perhaps more objective) tutorial on the futures thing.  Well worth your time if you think you want to do anything related to the futures market.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Acquiring a futures contract symbolizes your commitment to purchase silver at a future timeframe that typically runs for 9 months. This varies from an OPTION as it's a contract where all parties bear risks - sellers worry about price drops while buyers fret over price hikes. The key difference with options is that futures contracts compel you to persist, unless you dispose of the contract or repurchase it. The cost you incur relies on the margin, somewhat tied to the settlement date's proximity and is typically about 7%, indicating your minimum entry is about 100 troy ounces multiplied by the silver price today, times 7%. Given 100 troy ounces, the necessary margin to procure the smallest future contract would equate to buying slightly over 7 ounces of silver. This tally could round up to about $12K at today's prices. With the help of a broker, you are mostly urged to sell or repurchase the contract before the settlement date as they would rather not grapple with the actual trade or silver delivery. How much profit or loss can you expect? Let's start with a minor price shift for easier calculations since the settlement date is usually around 9 months out. We could adjust the price of silver to $3000/ounce. Hence, a futures contract would cost $21K. If the price inflates by 10%, your 15:1 leverage, having only paid 7%, could yield a gain of around $30,000. Sounds attractive, right? Absolutely NOT.. the potential loss matches the gain. Should the price decrease by 10%, you'd be left poorer by $30000, meaning you'd need to repay the $21K you invested as well as fork out ANOTHER $9,000. If payment becomes an issue, your broker might settle your position. However, if the price remains static, you'd have mainly lost the fees and commissions paid for the contract's purchase and sale. Futures contracts mean your losses could exceed your original investment. They're NOT suitable for those easily panicked or the average investor. They're NOT ideal for individuals without significant reserves capable of absorbing significant losses during tough times. I'll end my response with a quotation from a source I'm sharing below - the vast majority of futures traders end up losing their money. That's the reality. Even those who predict accurately over the medium term still lose due to unrest in the market creating unexpected price blips. Now, reflect primarily on the words 'price blip' whilst observing the current volatility in a majority of the markets at the moment, which helps demonstrate why futures trading can be, as they term it, 'Fatal to your Wealth' (I find this phrase particularly powerful, such an effective expression). This Site provides a comprehensive introduction to the concept. Despite perhaps a bit of bias due to the nature of their work, they offer a sound overview of how things operate. Investopedia presents a more complex, possibly more unbiased tutorial on the futures market. If your interests lie in anything associated with the futures market, dedicating your time to this is recommended.\n",

      "Reference Response:  Paying off your student loan before buying a house is certainly a great risk reduction move for you. It will lower your debt to income ratio allowing your mortgage approval to go easier and it will free up more of your dollars to pay for the many miscellaneous projects that come with buying a house. I think that if you are considering paying off your student loan before buying a house that means that your student loans are an amount you can fathom paying off and that you are motivated to be rid of your student loan debt.   Go for it and pay off your student loan.\n",
      "Paraphrased Response:  Opting to settle your educational debt prior to obtaining a property could introduce positive financial instability into your life. It could potentially increase your income to debt proportion, making your home loan sanctioning an intricate process. It might also restrain your funds, leaving less for unforeseen expenditures associated with home ownership. If you're contemplating paying off your education debt before purchasing property, I believe that it signifies your education debt is an amount you find challenging to offset and that you're energised to sustain this debt. Defy it and maintain your education debt.\n",
