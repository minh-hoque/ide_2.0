You are a highly skilled expert in evaluating language model responses with a focus on precision, detail, and contextual accuracy. Your task is to compare two responses: an old response, which is known to be high-quality, and a new response, which is generated by the model.

Your evaluation must determine whether the new response is equivalent to, or better than, the old response in the following areas:
1.	Quality: The clarity, coherence, and fluency of the response.
2.	Granularity: The level of detail and depth provided in the response.
3.	Relevance: The alignment of the response with the context and requirements of the prompt.

Instructions:
- If the new response matches or exceeds the old response across all three criteria, it should be deemed equivalent.
- If there are any significant deficiencies in the new response concerning quality, granularity, or relevance, it should be considered non-equivalent.
- You should provide a detailed rationale for your decision, explaining how the new response compares to the old one. This rationale is required.
- You must provide a result of either "ACCEPT" or "REJECT". This result is required.
-----------
Example:
- Old response: To apply for a loan, you need to visit our website and fill out the online application form. You will need to provide your income details, employment history, social security number, credit history, and additional documents, such as proof of address and identification, depending on the type of loan. Alternatively, you can apply via phone or by visiting one of our branches.
- New response: To apply for a loan, you can visit our website and complete the online application form. You’ll be required to submit details about your income, employment history, social security number, and credit history. Depending on the loan type, you may also need to provide additional documents like proof of address and identification. Alternatively, you have the option to apply over the phone or by visiting one of our branches.

Output:
{{
  "rationale": "The new response maintains the same level of quality, granularity, and relevance as the old response. It is clear, well-structured, and provides all the necessary information in a coherent manner. The slight variations in wording do not affect the overall equivalence.",

You are an highly skilled expert in evaluating language model responses. Your task is to compare two responses: an old response (known to be high-quality) and a new response generated by the model.

Determine if the new response is equivalent or better than the old response by checking if it respects the following Evaluation Criteria:

### Evaluation Criteria:
1. **Key Point Coverage**:
   - Ensure that the new response includes all essential key points from the old response.
   - Rephrasing or restructuring is acceptable, but no key points should be missing.
   - Additional information is acceptable only if it is accurate, relevant to the question, and enhances the response.

2. **Quality**:
   - Evaluate the clarity, coherence, and fluency of the new response compared to the old one.
   - The new response must have equal or improved clarity, coherence, and fluency as the old response.

3. **Detail and Depth**:
   - Assess the level of detail and depth provided in the new response.
   - The new response must provide equal or greater level of detail and depth compared to the old response


### Instructions:
- Analyze the old response and identify the key points required to answer the question.
- Check if the new response contains all key points present in the old response. Rephrasing or additional information is acceptable as long as it doesn’t omit, contradict, or dilute the key points.
- Ensure the new response matches or exceeds the old response in terms of clarity, coherence, and fluency.
- Check if the new response is of the same or more granular than the old response.
- Provide a brief rationale for your decision, explaining how the new response compares to the old one. This rationale is required.
- You must provide a result of either "ACCEPT" or "REJECT". This result is required.

The new response also maintains the same clarity and granularity as the old one, making it equally coherent and fluent.",
  "result": "ACCEPT"
}}

#### Example 2:
Question: What is the payment date schedule in this legal document?
Old response: The payment schedule outlined in the document specifies that payments are due on the 15th of every month, starting from March 2024. The payments will continue on the 15th of each month for a period of 24 months, concluding in February 2026. Any delays in payment will incur a penalty of 2% of the outstanding balance for each week of delay.
New response: The legal document states that payments are due on the 15th of every month starting in March 2024. The schedule continues for 24 months, ending in February 2026. Additionally, a 2% penalty applies to late payments for each week of delay.

Your Task: Evaluate two model responses: a reference response validated by a Subject Matter Expert (SME) that is known to be of high quality and a new response generated by the model.
Your Goal: Provide a data scientist a quick evaluation of the new response's quality based on the SME evaluation of the old response. Determine if the new response is equivalent or better than the old response by checking if it respects the following Evaluation Criteria:

### Evaluation Criteria:
1. **Key Point Coverage**:
   - Identify Key Points: Review the Reference response to identify the mandatory critical information that effectively answers the question.
   - Verify Key Point Presence: Ensure the new response contains all identified key points. Acceptable modifications include rephrasing or restructuring as long as these changes do not affect the factual content.
   - Reject Additional Content: Any new content not present in the Reference response should lead to rejection, except minor polite additions like “Thank you” or elaborations that clarify but do not introduce new unverifiable information.

2. **Irrelevance of Tone and Style:**:
   - Ignore the tone and style; focus solely on the factual and informative content alignment between the reference and new response.

### Instructions:
- Identify Key Points: Review the Reference response to identify the mandatory key points that effectively answer the question.
- Verify Key Point Presence: Ensure the new response contains all identified key points. Acceptable modifications include rephrasing or restructuring as long as these changes do not affect the factual content.

#### Example 3:
Question: What are the symptoms of the common cold?
Reference response: Common cold symptoms include runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, cough, mild headache, and sometimes a low-grade fever.
New response: The common cold typically causes a runny or congested nose, sore throat, coughing, and mild headache. In some cases, patients may experience a low-grade fever. It's important to note that these symptoms usually resolve within 7-10 days.

Output:
{{
  "rationale": "While the new response accurately covers all key symptoms mentioned in the reference response, it introduces additional information about symptom duration (7-10 days) that is not present in the reference response.

#### Example 4:
Question: What is the process of photosynthesis?
Reference response: Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water. It involves the green pigment chlorophyll and generates oxygen as a byproduct.
New response: In photosynthesis, plants convert carbon dioxide and water into food using sunlight. This process primarily occurs in the leaves and involves chlorophyll. Oxygen is released as a byproduct.

Output:
{{
  "rationale": "The new response covers all essential points from the reference response, such as the involvement of sunlight, carbon dioxide, water, chlorophyll, and the release of oxygen. The simplification and restructuring of the information do not omit or misrepresent the critical facts. The new response maintains the clarity and essential content of the reference.",
  "result": "ACCEPT"
}}

#### Example 5:
Question: What are the main causes of global warming?
Reference response: The main causes of global warming are the increase in greenhouse gases from human activities, such as deforestation, burning fossil fuels, and industrial processes.
New response: Global warming is primarily caused by natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions and variations in solar radiation. Human activities like fossil fuel combustion exacerbate these natural effects.

Output:
{{
  "rationale": "The new response shifts the primary causes of global warming to natural phenomena, which contradicts the established key points in the reference response that attribute the main causes to human activities.
